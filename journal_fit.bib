	abstract = {Information science (IS) is concerned with the searching and retrieval of test and other information (IR), mostly in electronic databases and on the Internet. Such databases contain fulltext (or other kinds of documents, e.g. pictures) and/or document representations and/or different kinds of "value added information". The core theoretical problem for IS is related to the determination of the usefulness of different "subject access points" in electronic databases. This problem is again related to theories of meaning and semantics.(2) This paper outlines some important principles in the design of documents done in the field of "composition studies". It maps the possible subject access points and presents research done on each kind of these. It shows how theories of IR must build on or relate to different theories of concepts and meaning. It: discusses two contrasting theories of semantics worked out by Ludwig Wittgenstein: "the picture theory" and "the theory of language games" and demonstrates the different consequences for such theories for IR. Finally, the implications for information professionals are discussed.},

	abstract = {Part-of-speech (POS) taggers are used in an increasing number of terminology applications. However, terminologists do not know exactly how they perform on specialized texts since most POS taggers have been trained on "general" corpora, that is, corpora containing all sorts of undifferentiated texts. In this article, we evaluate the performance of two POS taggers on French and English medical texts. The taggers are TnT (a statistical tagger developed at Saarland University (Brants 2000)) and WinBrill (the Windows version of the tagger initially developed by Eric Brill (1992)). Ten extracts from medical texts were submitted to the taggers and the outputs scanned manually. Results pertain to the accuracy of tagging in terms of correctly and incorrectly tagged words. We also study the handling of unknown words from different viewpoints.},

	abstract = {In a scientific and technological watch (STW) task, an expert user needs to survey the evolution of research topics in his area of specialisation in order to detect interesting changes. The majority of methods proposing evaluation metrics (bibliometrics and scientometrics studies) for STW rely solely on statistical data analysis methods (co-citation analysis, co-word analysis). Such methods usually work on structured databases where the units of analysis (words, keywords) are already attributed to documents by human indexers. The advent of huge amounts of unstructured textual data has rendered necessary the integration of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to first extract meaningful units from texts. We propose a method for STW which is NLP-oriented. The method not only analyses texts linguistically in order to extract terms from them, but also uses linguistic relations (syntactic variations) as the basis for clustering. Terms and variation relations are formalised as weighted di-graphs which the clustering algorithm, CPCL (Classification by Preferential Clustered Link) will seek to reduce in order to produces classes. These classes ideally represent the research topics present in the corpus. The results of the classification are subjected to validation by an expert in STW.},

Subjects attached to records representing cited works are compared to subjects attached to records representing the original citing sources, and to the subjects yielded by chasing see-also references from the latter group of headings. Original citing sources were yielded via a subject-list search in a library catalog using the subject heading "Language and languages - Origin." A subject-search was employed to avoid subjectivity in choosing sources. References from the sources were searched in OCLC where applicable, and the subject headings were retrieved. The subjects were ranked first by number of citations from original sources, then by total citation-frequency. The results were tiered into four groups in a Bradford-like distribution. A similar rank and division was performed on the subjects representing the original citing sources, and those yielded by chasing see-also references. Both in terms of subject frequency and topic type, positive comparisons between citation-chasing and see-also references show a confirmation of different methods of yielding alternative subjects. Exclusive results suggest potential mutual complementary value among these different methods.},

Organization of this vast body of digital information assumes significance in this context. The sheer volume of digital information to be handled makes traditional indexing and knowledge representation strategies ineffective and impractical. It is, therefore, worth exploring new approaches. An approach being discussed considers the intrinsic semantics of texts of documents. Based on the hypothesis that noun phrases in a text are semantically rich in terms of their ability to represent the subject content of the document, this approach seeks to identify and extract noun phrases instead of single keywords, and use them as descriptors. This paper presents a methodology that has been developed for extracting noun phrases from Portuguese texts. The results of an experiment carried out to test the adequacy of the methodology are also presented.},

By integrating the classification process into a mathematical model, a knowledge classifier, based on the maximum entropy theory, is constructed and the experimental results show that the classification results acquired from the classifier are reliable. The approach proposed in this paper is quite formal and is not dependent on specific contexts, so it could easily be adapted to the use of knowledge classification in other domains within KO.},

	issn = {0943-7444},
	abstract = {Any ontological theory commits us to accept and classify a number of phenomena in a more or less specific way-and vice versa: a classification tends to reveal the theoretical outlook of its creator. Objects and their descriptions and relations are not just "given," but determined by theories. Knowledge is fallible, and consensus is rare. By implication, knowledge organization has to consider different theories/views and their foundations. Bibliographical classifications depend on subject knowledge and on the same theories as corresponding scientific and scholarly classifications. Some classifications are based on logical distinctions, others on empirical examinations, and some on mappings of common ancestors or on establishing functional criteria. To evaluate a classification is to involve oneself in the research which has produced the given classification. Because research is always based more or less on specific epistemological ideals (e.g., empiricism, rationalism, historicism, or pragmatism), the evaluation of classification includes the evaluation of the epistemological foundations of the research on which given classifications have been based. The field of knowledge organization itself is based on different approaches and traditions such as user-based and cognitive views, facet-analytical views, numeric taxonomic approaches, bibliometrics, and domain-analytic approaches. These approaches and traditions are again connected to epistemological views, which have to be considered. Only the domain-analytic view is fully committed to exploring knowledge organization in the light of subject knowledge and substantial scholarly theories.},

One of the major limitations in today's plagiarism checkers is their sole dependence on text-based detection, where they ignore the citation and structural information. Further, the text-based detection approaches that they employ usually fail to trace out intelligent manipulations. In the proposed work, a plagiarism detection system is presented that employs the effective coupling of various modules, namely, logical structure classifications and citation parsing, two-stage candidate document selections, syntax-semantic-based exhaustive passage level analysis with plagiarism analysis using structural and citation information. Further, a new plagiarism score, namely, weighted overall similarity index is proposed, opposed to the general plagiarism scores. The proposed approach is evaluated on the data set created by Alzahrani et al. (), which contains scientific publications imposed with various plagiarism complexities. Comparison of the final system results is done against a potential baseline approach. The proposed approach exhibits considerable improvement over the comparative baseline, and hence reflects the potency of syntax-semantic text-based analysis with structural and citation information.},

Yet, given a data set, there is no quantitative, consistent, and established way of knowing how it has been used over time, who contributed to its curation, what results have been yielded, or what value it has. The development of a theory and practice of data citation is fundamental for considering data as first-class research objects with the same relevance and centrality of traditional scientific products. Many works in recent years have discussed data citation from different viewpoints: illustrating why data citation is needed, defining the principles and outlining recommendations for data citation systems, and providing computational methods for addressing specific issues of data citation. The current panorama is many-faceted and an overall view that brings together diverse aspects of this topic is still missing. Therefore, this paper aims to describe the lay of the land for data citation, both from the theoretical (the why and what) and the practical (the how) angle.},

This article assesses the conceptual and empirical delineation of retractions against related publication types through a comparative analysis of the coverage and consistency of retraction annotation in the databases PubMed and the Web of Science (WoS), which are both commonly used for empicial studies on retractions. The searching and linking approaches of the WoS were subsequently evaluated. The results indicate that a considerable number of PubMed retracted publications and retractions are not labeled as such in the WoS or are indistinguishable from corrections, which is highly relevant for corpus and sample strategies in the WoS.},

Next, a set of criteria for the identification of emerging topics is proposed according to the adjusted definition and attributes of emergence. Using two sets of parameter values, several emerging research topics are identified.

Through a correlation analysis of topic and subject, we show the application of LDA in different subjects. We also reveal the cross-boundary diffusion between different subjects based on the analysis of the interdisciplinary studies. The results show that as LDA is transferred into different areas, the adoption of each subject is relatively adjacent to those with similar research interests.

The principal argument is that existing models of information exchange and use do not sufficiently take account of the multiplicity of networked users as a source of value, for example, their implicit and explicit interactions with other users, and with the information system. We briefly review existing kinds of value that have been theorized, operationalized, and measured in the information science literature. Principally, these are the notions of information as embedded value; and information and information systems as adding value. To these notions we add the further notion of connected or cocreated value.

Our findings show that our respondents use indicators to a considerable degree, with a range of indicators and rankings being employed. The scholars use metrics as part of institutional policy, in CVs and applications, as well as for general promotion of their work. Notable in our results is that a much larger share of researchers (62\%) in Australia used metrics compared to Sweden (14\%). Scholar's attitudes regarding bibliometrics are mixed; many are critical of these measures, while at the same time feeling pressured to use them. One main tension described by our respondents is between intradisciplinary criteria of quality and formalized indicators, and negotiating these "orders of worth" is a challenging balancing act, especially for younger researchers.},

This study serves to fill this gap by using a large longitudinal dataset to examine these differences. Using CiteScore as a proxy for journal scientific impact, we employ a series of statistical tests to identify the quartile categories and disciplinary areas in which impact trends differ notably between closed-and open-access journals. We find that closed-access journals have a noticeable advantage in social sciences (for example, business and economics), whereas open-access journals perform well in medical and healthcare domains (for example, health profession and nursing). Moreover, we find that after controlling for a journal's rank and disciplinary differences, there are statistically more closed-access journals in the top 10\%, Quartile 1, and Quartile 2 categories asmeasured by CiteScore; in contrast, more open-access journals in Quartile 4 gained scientific impact from 2011 to 2015. Considering dynamic and disciplinary trends in tandem, we find that more closed-access journals in Social Sciences gained in impact, whereas in biochemistry and medicine, more open-access journals experienced such gains.},

The factors include journal impact factor, individual collaboration, international collaboration, institution prestige, country prestige, research funding, abstract readability, abstract length, title length, number of cited references, field size, and field type and will be modeled in association with citation counts, Mendeley readers, Twitter posts, Facebook posts, blog posts, and news posts. The results demonstrate that eight factors are important for increased citation counts, seven different factors are important for increased Mendeley readers, eight factors are important for increased Twitter posts, three factors are important for increased Facebook posts, six factors are important for increased blog posts, and five factors are important for increased news posts. Journal impact factor and international collaboration are the two factors that significantly associate with increased citation counts and with all altmetric scores. Moreover, it seems that the factors driving Mendeley readership are similar to those driving citation counts. However, the altmetric events differ from each other in terms of a small number of factors; for instance, institution prestige and country prestige associate with increased Mendeley readers and blog and news posts, but it is an insignificant factor for Twitter and Facebook posts. The findings contribute to the continued development of theoretical models and methodological developments associated with capturing, interpreting, and understanding altmetric events.},

The result is that the consequences of the move from the WoS to the G8 system using the Top 1\% citation impact indicator are much greater than the consequences of this move using the Top 10\% indicator. Second, we compare the G8 classification system and a publication-level alternative of the same family, the G6 system, consisting of 1,363 clusters. The result is that, although less important than in the previous case, the consequences of the move from the G6 to the G8 system under the Top 1\% indicator are still of a large order of magnitude.},

Here we systematically study and classify citation patterns of atypical articles, finding that they can be characterized by awakened articles, second-acts, and a combination of both. We propose a second-act model that can accurately describe the citation dynamics of second-act articles. The model not only provides a mechanistic framework to understand citation patterns of atypical articles, separating factors that drive impact, but it also offers new capabilities to identify the time of exogenous events that influence citations.},

Here, we extend the study of citation dynamics to a more general diffusion process to understand how citation growth associates with different diffusion patterns. Using a classic diffusion model, we quantify and illustrate specific diffusion mechanisms which have been proven to exert a significant impact on the growth and decay of citation counts. Experiments reveal a positive relation between the low p and low q pattern and high scientific impact. A sharp citation peak produced by rapid change of citation counts, however, has a negative effect on future impact. In addition, we have suggested a simple indicator, saturation level, to roughly estimate an individual article's current stage in the life cycle and its potential to attract future attention. The proposed approach can also be extended to higher levels of aggregation (e.g., individual scientists, journals, institutions), providing further insights into the practice of scientific evaluation.},

Specifically, we analyze collaborators using 2 indicators: the research topic diversity, measured by the Author-Conference-Topic model and cosine, and the impact diversity, measured by the normalized standard deviation of h-indices. We find that the collaborators of high-impact researchers tend to study diverse research topics and have diverse h-indices. Moreover, by setting PhD graduation as an important milestone in researchers' careers, we examine several indicators related to scientific collaboration and their effects on a career. The results show that collaborating with authoritative authors plays an important role prior to a researcher's PhD graduation, but working with non-authoritative authors carries more weight after PhD graduation.},

Exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are applied in this research. We find that different types of publications one author has written play diverse roles in his/her collaborations. An author's tendency to form new collaborations with her/his coauthors' collaborators is strong, where the more coauthors one author had before, the more new collaborators he/she will attract.

Moreover, it provides a reasonable explanation for the emergence of transitions with the difference of collaboration behaviors between leaders and other members.

The main result of this study shows that RS are more effective (in terms of precision/recall values) than JCS to identify highly cited publications across all fields of science and publication years. The findings also show that 86.5\% of all the publications are covered by Mendeley and have at least one reader. Also, the share of publications with Mendeley RS is increasing from 84\% in 2004 to 89\% in 2009, and decreasing from 88\% in 2010 to 82\% in 2013. However, it is noted that publications from 2010 onwards exhibit on average a higher density of readership versus citation scores. This indicates that compared to citation scores, RS are more prevalent for recent publications and hence they could work as an early indicator of research impact. These findings highlight the potential and value of Mendeley as a tool for scientometric purposes and particularly as a relevant tool to identify highly cited publications.},

This gap can be filled by Mendeley reader counts, which are valuable early impact indicators for academic articles because they appear before citations and correlate strongly with them. Nevertheless, it is not known how Mendeley readership counts accumulate within the year of publication, and so it is unclear how soon they can be used. In response, this paper reports a longitudinal weekly study of the Mendeley readers of articles in 6 library and information science journals from 2016. The results suggest that Mendeley readers accrue from when articles are first available online and continue to steadily build. For journals with large publication delays, articles can already have substantial numbers of readers by their publication date. Thus, Mendeley reader counts may even be useful as early impact indicators for articles before they have been officially published in a journal issue. If field normalized indicators are needed, then these can be generated when journal issues are published using the online first date.},

Current subject indexing systems do not make adequate distinctions on the importance of assigned subject descriptors. Assigning numeric weights to subject descriptors to distinguish their importance to the documents can strengthen the role of subject metadata. Automated methods are more cost-effective. This study compares different automated weighting methods in different environments. Two evaluation methods were used to assess the performance. Experiments on three datasets in the biomedical domain suggest the performance of different weighting methods depends on whether it is an abstract or full text environment. Mutual information with bag-of-words representation shows the best average performance in the full text environment, while cosine with bag-of-words representation is the best in an abstract environment. The cosine measure has relatively consistent and robust performance. A direct weighting method, IDF (Inverse Document Frequency), can produce quick and reasonable estimates of the weights. Bag-of-words representation generally outperforms the concept-based representation. Further improvement in performance can be obtained by using the learning-to-rank method to integrate different weighting methods. This study follows up Lu and Mao (Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 66, 1776-1784, 2015), in which an automated weighted subject indexing method was proposed and validated. The findings from this study contribute to more effective weighted subject indexing.},

The effect of hybrid open access on citation counts and author behavior in the field of chemistry is something that has not been widely studied. We compared 814 open access articles and 27,621 subscription access articles published from 2006 through 2011 in American Chemical Society journals. As expected, the 2 comparison groups are not equal in all respects. Cumulative citation data were analyzed from years 2-5 following an article's publication date. A citation advantage for open access articles was correlated with the journal impact factor (IF) in low and medium IF journals, but not in high IF journals. Open access articles have a 24\% higher mean citation rate than their subscription counterparts in low IF journals (confidence limits 8-42\%, p = .0022) and similarly, a 26\% higher mean citation rate in medium IF journals (confidence limits 14-40\%, p {\textless} .001). Open access articles in high IF journals had no significant difference compared to subscription access articles (13\% lower mean citation rate, confidence limits -27-3\%, p = .10). These results are correlative, not causative, and may not be completely due to an open access effect. Authors of the open access articles were also surveyed to determine why they chose a hybrid open access option, paid the required article processing charge, and whether they believed it was money well spent. Authors primarily chose open access because of funding mandates; however, most considered the money well spent because open access increases information access to the scientific community and the general public, and potentially increases citations to their scholarship.},

We analyzed 829,924 articles that received 16,490,346 citations. The number of articles published through coauthorship accounts for 89\%. The citation-based performance and coauthorship patterns exhibit a power-law correlation with a scaling exponent of 1.20 +/- 0.07. Citations to a subfield's research articles tended to increase 2.(1.20) or 2.30 times each time it doubled the number of coauthored papers. The scaling exponent for the power-law relationship for single-authored papers was 0.85 +/- 0.11. The citations to a subfield's single-authored research articles increased 2.(0.85) or 1.89 times each time the research area doubled the number of single-authored papers. The Matthew Effect is stronger for coauthored papers than for single-authored. In fact, with a scaling exponent {\textless}1.0 the impact of single-authored papers exhibits a cumulative disadvantage or inverse Matthew Effect.},

This article seeks to address this gap through an international and interdisciplinary survey of academics. Issues covered include: use of and intentions regarding OAP, and perceptions regarding advantages and disadvantages of OAP, journal article publication services, peer review, and reuse. Despite reporting engagement in OAP, academics were unsure about their future intentions regarding OAP. Broadly, academics identified the potential for wider circulation as the key advantage of OAP, and were more positive about its benefits than they were negative about its disadvantages. As regards services, rigorous peer review, followed by rapid publication were most valued. Academics reported strong views on reuse of their work; they were relatively happy with noncommercial reuse, but not in favor of commercial reuse, adaptations, and inclusion in anthologies. Comparing science, technology, and medicine with arts, humanities, and social sciences showed a significant difference in attitude on a number of questions, but, in general, the effect size was small, suggesting that attitudes are relatively consistent across the academic community.},

It models the "total cost of publication"comprising costs of journal subscriptions, OA article-processing charges (APCs), and new administrative costs-for a sample of 24 institutions. APCs are shown to constitute 12\% of the "total cost of publication," APC administration, 1\%, and subscriptions, 87\% (for a sample of seven publishers). APC expenditure in institutions rose between 2012 and 2014 at the same time as rising subscription costs. There was disproportionately high take up of Gold options for Health and Life Sciences articles. APC prices paid varied widely, with a mean APC of 1,586 pound in 2014. "Hybrid" options (subscription journals also offering OA for individual articles on payment of an APC) were considerably more expensive than fully OA titles, but the data indicate a correlation between APC price and journal quality (as reflected in the citation rates of journals). The policy implications of these developments are explored, particularly in relation to hybrid OA and potential of offsetting subscription and APC costs.},

In this study, we investigate retractions from a quantitative perspective, aiming to answer two fundamental questions. One, how do retractions influence the scholarly impact of retracted papers, authors, and institutions? Two, does this influence propagate to the wider academic community through scholarly associations? Specifically, we analyzed a set of retracted articles indexed in Thomson Reuters Web of Science (WoS), and ran multiple experiments to compare changes in scholarly impact against a control set of nonretracted articles, authors, and institutions. We further applied the Granger Causality test to investigate whether different scientific topics are dynamically affected by retracted papers occurring within those topics. Our results show two key findings: first, the scholarly impact of retracted papers and authors significantly decreases after retraction, and the most severe impact decrease correlates with retractions based on proven, purposeful scientific misconduct; second, this retraction penalty does not seem to spread through the broader scholarly social graph, but instead has a limited and localized effect. Our findings may provide useful insights for scholars or science committees to evaluate the scholarly value of papers, authors, or institutions related to retractions.},

We find that a journal's academic status (impact factor) and accessibility (open access policy) both strongly increase the probability of it being referenced on Wikipedia. Controlling for field and impact factor, the odds that an open access journal is referenced on the English Wikipedia are 47\% higher compared to paywall journals.

We explore whether the peaks in the spectrograms generated by Reference Publication Years Spectroscopy (RPYS) indicate such long-term impact by comparing across RPYS for subsequent time intervals. Multi-RPYS enables us to distinguish between short-term citation peaks at the research front that decay within 10 years versus historically constitutive (long-term) citations that function as concept symbols. Using these constitutive citations, one is able to cluster document sets (e.g., journals) in terms of intellectually shared histories. We test this premise by clustering 40 journals in the Web of Science Category of Information and Library Science using multi-RPYS. It follows that RPYS can not only be used for retrieving roots of sets under study (cited), but also for algorithmic historiography of the citing sets. Significant references are historically rooted symbols among other citations that function as currency.},

Referees from the humanities tend to be more generous in their recommendations than other referees, especially economists and environmental scientists. Second, we found that senior researchers are harsher in their judgments than junior researchers, and the latter accept requests to review more often and are faster in reporting. Finally, we found that articles that had been refereed and recommended for publication by a multidisciplinary set of referees were subsequently more likely to receive citations than those that had been reviewed by referees from the same discipline.

The main result of the method is a map of scientific evolutionary pathways. The visual routines provide a way to indicate the interactions among scientific subjects and a version in a series of time slices helps further illustrate such evolutionary pathways in detail. The detailed outline offers sufficient statistical information to delve into scientific topics and routines and then helps address meaningful insights with the assistance of expert knowledge. This empirical study focuses on scientific proposals granted by the United States National Science Foundation, and demonstrates the feasibility and reliability.

The study analyzes 1,131,318 articles published in 2012, with minimum tweeted (10), saved to Mendeley (100), and cited (10) thresholds. The results show surprisingly minor overall overlaps between the three phenomena. The importance of journals for Twitter and the presence of many bots at different levels of activity suggest that this site has little value for impact altmetrics. The moderate differences between patterns of saving and citation suggest that Mendeley can be used for some types of impact assessments, but sensitivity is needed for underlying differences.},

To expose the relationship between the predictor variables and the response variable, we use quantile regression. We found that a higher number of references, a higher share of references to publications within Web of Science and references to more recent publications correlate with citation impact. A correlation was observed even when normalization was done with a finely grained classification system. The predictor variables affected citation impact to a larger extent at higher quantile levels. Regarding the relative importance of the predictor variables, citation impact of the cited references was in general the least important variable. Number of cited references carried most of the importance for both low and medium quantile levels, but this importance was lessened at the highest considered level.},

Measuring the Semantic Similarity (SS) with higher accuracy is a challenging task. In this context, the Information Content (IC)-based SS measure has gained popularity over the others. The notion of IC evolves from the science of information theory. Information theory has very high potential to characterize the semantics of concepts. Designing an IC-based SS framework comprises (i) an IC calculator, and (ii) an SS calculator. In this article, we propose a generic intrinsic IC-based SS calculator. We also introduce here a new structural aspect of an ontology called DCS (Disjoint Common Subsumers) that plays a significant role in deciding the similarity between two concepts. We evaluated our proposed similarity calculator with the existing intrinsic IC-based similarity calculators, as well as corpora-dependent similarity calculators using several benchmark data sets. The experimental results show that the proposed similarity calculator produces a high correlation with human evaluation over the existing state-of-the-art IC-based similarity calculators.},

Currently, the practice of formal data citation-where data references are included alongside bibliographic references in the reference section of a publication-is uncommon. We examine the prevalence of data citation, documenting data sharing and reuse, in a sample of full text articles from the biological/biomedical sciences, the fields with the most public data sets available documented by the Data Citation Index (DCI). We develop a method that combines automated text extraction with human assessment for revealing candidate occurrences of data sharing and reuse by using terms that are most likely to indicate their occurrence. The analysis reveals that informal data citation in the main text of articles is far more common than formal data citations in the references of articles. As a result, data sharers do not receive documented credit for their data contributions in a similar way as authors do for their research articles because informal data citations are not recorded in sources such as the DCI. Ongoing challenges for the study of data citation are also outlined.},

The best state-of-the-art approaches require training data in order to learn thresholds for deciding when to group the webpages. However, the ambiguity level of person names on the web could not be previously estimated and the results of those methods strongly depend on the thresholds obtained with the training collections. We present the concept of adaptive threshold, which avoids the need of a previous supervised learning process, depending only on the content of the compared documents to decide if they refer to the same person. We evaluated our approach using three datasets reaching close results to those obtained by the most successful algorithms in the state-of-the-art that require such a learning process, and outperforming the results of those obtained by algorithms that do not require it.},

A taxonomy needs to be comprehensive and accurate if it is to be useful for policy making, especially now that policy makers are utilizing citation-based indicators to evaluate people, institutions and laboratories. Determining the accuracy of a taxonomy, however, remains a challenge. Previous work on the accuracy of partition solutions is sparse, and the results of those studies, although useful, have not been definitive. In this study we compare the accuracies of topic-level taxonomies based on the clustering of documents using direct citation, bibliographic coupling, and co-citation. Using a set of new gold standards-articles with at least 100 references- we find that direct citation is better at concentrating references than either bibliographic coupling or co-citation. Using the assumption that higher concentrations of references denote more accurate clusters, direct citation thus provides a more accurate representation of the taxonomy of scientific and technical knowledge than either bibliographic coupling or co-citation. We also find that discipline-level taxonomies based on journal schema are highly inaccurate compared to topic-level taxonomies, and recommend against their use.},

We return to the word/document matrix using first a single text with a strong argument (" The Leiden Manifesto") and then upscale to a sample of moderate size (n = 5687) to study the pros and cons of the two approaches in terms of the resulting possibilities for making semantic maps that can serve an argument. The results from co-wordmapping (using two different routines) versus topic modeling are significantly uncorrelated. Whereas components in the co-word maps can easily be designated, the topic models provide sets of words that are very differently organized. In these samples, the topic models seem to reveal similarities other than semantic ones (e.g., linguistic ones). In other words, topic modeling does not replace co-word mapping in small and medium-sized sets; but the paper leaves open the possibility that topic modeling would work well for the semantic mapping of large sets.},

Findings show high recall (around 93\%) of WoS funding data. By contrast, MEDLINE/ PubMed data retrieved less than half of the UK cancer publications acknowledging at least one funder. Conversely, both databases have high precision (+90\%): That is, few cases of publications with no acknowledgment to funders are identified as having funding data. Nonetheless, funders acknowledged in UK cancer publications were not correctly listed by MEDLINE/PubMed and WoS in around 75\% and 32\% of the cases, respectively. Reference data on the UK cancer research funding system are used as a case study to demonstrate the utility of funding data for strategic intelligence applications (e.g., mapping of funding landscape and co-funding activity, comparison of funders' research portfolios).},

Our analysis shows that interdisciplinary projects offer a unique opportunity to create impact on a number of different levels. Moreover, it demonstrates that a lack of accountable design and collaboration practices can potentially hinder pathways to impact. Finally, we find that the interdisciplinary perspectives that such projects introduce encourage a rich gamut of sustainable outcomes that go beyond commercialization. Our findings support researchers working in these complex contexts to appreciate the opportunities and challenges involved in interdisciplinary cross-sector research contexts while imparting them with strategies for overcoming these challenges.},

A measure of author publishing choices was used to define four ecological characteristics: coverage, coreness, exclusivity, and journal overlap. Several types of journals indexed in the Information Science and Library Science section of the Journal Citation Reports are compared in terms of their ecological characteristics. The data show that some journals cover large numbers of authors, but compete with other journals in subcommunities. Some journals with author profiles similar to those of high-ranking journals lost potential submissions. Others with low coverage, high coreness, and high exclusivity were found to have groups of " fans" who used them for all of their submissions, but still exhibited a strong need to sustain their exclusivity. It is hoped that the method and results presented in this paper will provide useful information for editorial boards interested in managing their submissions according to author profiles.},

After summarizing the main criticisms of rankings, we describe 2 trends in the user requirements for indicators; namely, granularity and cross-referencing. We then suggest that a change in the paradigm of the design and production of indicators is needed. The traditional approach is one that not only leverages on the existing data but also suggests heavy investment to integrate existing databases and to build up tailored indicators. We show, based on the European universities case, how the intelligent integration of existing data may lead to an open-linked data platform which permits the construction of new indicators. The power of the approach derives from the ability to combine heterogeneous sources of data to generate indicators that address a variety of user requirements without the need to design indicators on a custom basis.},

We investigate whether the huge efforts of computing the NI are justified and whether the size-dependent NI indicators should be complemented by size-independent variants. The analysis uses data from the Max Planck Digital Library in-house database (which is based on Web of Science data) and from the NPG. In the first step of the analysis, we correlate the NI with other metrics that are simpler to generate than the NI. The resulting large correlation coefficients point out that the NI produces similar results as simpler solutions. In the second step of the analysis, relative and size-independent variants of the NI are generated that should be additionally presented by the NPG.

This is a problem because the discourse of the weak discipline creates conceptual confusion in relation to interdisciplinarity. Considering the growth of the iSchools and what is assumed to be a major institutional redrawing of boundaries, there is a pressing need to conceptualize interdisciplinary practices and boundary work. This paper explores the "weak" discipline through a discourse analytical lens and identifies a myth. Perceiving the discipline as weak is part of a myth, fueled by the ideal of a unitary discipline; the ideal discipline has strong boundaries, and as long as the discourse continues to focus on a need for boundaries, the only available discourse is one that articulates the discipline as weak. Thus, the myth is a vicious circle that can be broken if weakness is no longer ascribed to the discipline by tradition. The paper offers an explanation of the workings of the myth so that its particular way of interpreting the world does not mislead us when theorizing interdisciplinarity. This is a conceptual paper, and the examples serve as an empirical backdrop to the conceptual argument.},

Reading occurs before citing, however, and so it makes sense to count readers rather than citations for recent publications. To assess this, Mendeley readers and citations were obtained for articles from 2004 to late 2014 in five broad categories (agriculture, business, decision science, pharmacy, and the social sciences) and 50 subcategories. In these areas, citation counts tended to increase with every extra year since publication, and readership counts tended to increase faster initially but then stabilize after about 5 years. The correlation between citations and readers was also higher for longer time periods, stabilizing after about 5 years. Although there were substantial differences between broad fields and smaller differences between subfields, the results confirm the value of Mendeley reader counts as early scientific impact indicators.},

On the other hand, the expected values for several institutes can be compared with one another or with a set of randomly selected publications.

The results show that measured by scientific impact, the subjects of Chemical Engineering, Energy, and Environmental Science have the fastest growth. Furthermore, most subjects are carrying out more diversified knowledge trading practices by importing higher volumes of knowledge from a greater number of subjects. The study also finds that the growth rates of disciplinary citations align with the growth rates of global research and development (R\&D) expenditures, thus providing evidence to support the impact of R\&D expenditures on knowledge production.},

Plotting Nobel numbers over several decades provides a quantitative as well as visual indication of a researcher's proximity to the intuitive center of a discipline as defined by recognized scientific achievement. It is shown that the Nobel number distributions for physics of several researchers both within and outside of physics are surprisingly flat over the five-decade span from 1951 to 2000. A model in which Nobel laureates are typically connected by short coauthorship paths both intergenerationally and between subdisciplines reproduces such flat Nobel number distributions.},

Our results show a widening of the knowledge base from referencing the multidisciplinary journals Nature and Science to citing journals from specialist fields.

We develop a coding scheme to identify software mentions and classify them according to their characteristics and ability to realize the functions of citations. Overall, we find diverse and problematic practices: Only between 31\% and 43\% of mentions involve formal citations; informal mentions are very common, even in high impact factor journals and across different kinds of software. Software is frequently inaccessible (15\%-29\% of packages in any form; between 90\% and 98\% of specific versions; only between 24\%-40\% provide source code). Cites to publications are particularly poor at providing version information, whereas informal mentions are particularly poor at providing crediting information. We provide recommendations to improve the practice of software citation, highlighting recent nascent efforts.

CC has been expected to alleviate societal problems such as hyper-consumption, pollution, and poverty by lowering the cost of economic coordination within communities. However, beyond anecdotal evidence, there is a dearth of understanding why people participate in CC. Therefore, in this article we investigate people's motivations to participate in CC. The study employs survey data (N=168) gathered from people registered onto a CC site. The results show that participation in CC is motivated by many factors such as its sustainability, enjoyment of the activity as well as economic gains. An interesting detail in the result is that sustainability is not directly associated with participation unless it is at the same time also associated with positive attitudes towards CC. This suggests that sustainability might only be an important factor for those people for whom ecological consumption is important. Furthermore, the results suggest that in CC an attitude-behavior gap might exist; people perceive the activity positively and say good things about it, but this good attitude does not necessary translate into action.},

First, the universality claim, according to which all university-citation distributions, appropriately normalized, follow a single functional form, is not supported by the data. Second, the 500 university citation distributions are all highly skewed and very similar. Broadly speaking, university citation distributions appear to behave as if they differ by a relatively constant scale factor over a large, intermediate part of their support. Third, citation-impact differences between universities account for 3.85\% of overall citation inequality. This percentage is greatly reduced when university citation distributions are normalized using their mean normalized citation scores (MNCSs) as normalization factors. Finally, regarding practical consequences, we only need a single explanatory model for the type of high skewness characterizing all university citation distributions, and the similarity of university citation distributions goes a long way in explaining the similarity of the university rankings obtained with the MNCS and the Top 10\% indicator.},

Taking a domain analytic approach, the analysis draws on Becher and Trowler's (2001) and Whitley's (2000) theories to gain a deeper understanding of why OA repositories (OAR) play a particularly important role in the chosen disciplines. The surveys provided a unique opportunity to compare perceptions, motivations, and behaviors of researchers at the discipline level with the parent metadiscipline. It should be noted that participants were not drawn from a stratified sample of all the different subdisciplines that constitute each discipline, and therefore the generalizability of the findings to the discipline may be limited. The differential role of informal and formal communication in each of the three disciplines has shaped green OA practices. For physicists and economists, preprints are an essential feature of their respective OAR landscapes, whereas for clinical medics final published articles have a central role. In comparing the disciplines with their parent metadisciplines there were some notable similarities/differences, which have methodological implications for studying research cultures.},

We utilize a web analytics approach for the creation of a linear regression model to predict usage among these journals. We categorize metrics into two classes: global (journal focused) and local (institution dependent). Using 275 journals for our training set, our analysis shows that a combination of global and local metrics creates the strongest model for predicting full-text downloads. Our linear regression model has an accuracy of more than 80\% in predicting downloads for the 1,235 journals in our test set. The implications of the findings are that university libraries that use local metrics have better insight into the value of a journal and therefore more efficient cost content management.},

Moreover, the conditions under which accessibility and quality are important are not well understood. The goal of our study is to shed more light on both issues by assessing the role of different dimensions of accessibility and quality and how their importance is affected by time pressure. We conducted a policy-capturing study in which 89 financial specialists participated. Each judged 20 scenarios in which the accessibility and quality of human information sources, as well as time pressure, were manipulated. Results showed that both accessibility and quality affect the likelihood of asking a human information source for information. Moreover, although the weights attached to physical accessibility and the source's perceived technical quality were indeed moderated by time pressure, in both conditions we find support for a cost-benefit model of information seeking, in which both accessibility and quality are significant influences.},

In this paper we present a system that predicts the future impact of a scientific concept, represented as a technical term, based on the information available from recently published research articles. We analyze the usefulness of rich features derived from the full-text of the articles through a variety of approaches, including rhetorical sentence analysis, information extraction, and time-series analysis. The results from two large-scale experiments with 3.8 million full-text articles and 48 million metadata records support the conclusion that full-text features are significantly more useful for prediction than metadata-only features and that the most accurate predictions result from combining the metadata and full-text features. Surprisingly, these results hold even when the metadata features are available for a much larger number of documents than are available for the full-text features.},

Unfortunately, many authors avoid listing sufficient keywords for their papers. As such, these applications may need to automatically associate good descriptive keywords with papers. When the full text of the paper is available this problem has been thoroughly studied. In many cases, however, due to copyright limitations, research databases do not have access to the full text. On the other hand, such databases typically maintain metadata, such as the title and abstract and the citation network of each paper. In this paper we study the problem of predicting which keywords are appropriate for a research paper, using different methods based on the citation network and available metadata. Our main goal is in providing search engines with the ability to extract keywords from the available metadata. However, our system can also be used for other applications, such as for recommending keywords for the authors of new papers. We create a data set of research papers, and their citation network, keywords, and other metadata, containing over 470K papers with and more than 2 million keywords. We compare our methods with predicting keywords using the title and abstract, in offline experiments and in a user study, concluding that the citation network provides much better predictions.},

	abstract = {The evaluation of scientific research is crucial for both the academic community and society as a whole. Numerous bibliometric indices have been proposed for the ranking of research performance, mainly on an ad hoc basis. We introduce the novel class of Scientific Research Measures (SRMs) to rank scientists' research performance and provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for these measures. In contrast to many bibliometric indices, SRMs take into account the whole citation curve of the scientist, offer appealing structural properties, allow a finer ranking of scientists, correspond to specific features of different disciplines, research areas and seniorities, and include several bibliometric indices as special cases. Thus SRMs result in more accurate rankings than ad hoc bibliometric indices. We also introduce the further general class of Dual SRMs that reflect the value of journals and permit the ranking of research institutions based on theoretically sound criteria, which has been a central theme in the scientific community over recent decades. An empirical application to the citation curves of 173 finance scholars shows that SRMs can be easily calibrated to actual citation curves and generate different authors' rankings than those produced by seven traditional bibliometric indices.},

We present a map of Finnish science based on unsupervised-learning classification, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this approach vis-a-vis those generated by human reasoning. We conclude that from theoretical and practical perspectives there exist several challenges for human reasoning-based classification frameworks of scientific knowledge, as they typically try to fit new-to-the-world knowledge into historical models of scientific knowledge, and cannot easily be deployed for new large-scale data sets. Automated classification schemes, in contrast, generate classification models only from the available text corpus, thereby identifying credibly novel bodies of knowledge. They also lend themselves to versatile large-scale data analysis, and enable a range of Big Data possibilities. However, we also argue that it is neither possible nor fruitful to declare one or another method a superior approach in terms of realism to classify scientific knowledge, and we believe that the merits of each approach are dependent on the practical objectives of analysis.},

We hypothesized that PSP clustering is mainly affected by countries' geographic location, ethnicity, and level of economic development, as indicated in previous studies. Our results showed that the 100 countries with the highest rates of publications were decomposed into 12 PSP groups and that countries within a group tended to be geographically proximal, ethnically similar, or comparable in terms of economic status. Hubs and bridging nodes in each knowledge production group were identified. The performance of each group was evaluated across 16 knowledge domains based on their specialization, volume of publications, and relative impact. Awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of each group in various knowledge domains may have useful applications for examining scientific policies, adjusting the allocation of resources, and promoting international collaboration for future developments.},

Using data from 29 UK institutions, it finds that the administrative time, as well as the cost incurred by universities, to make an article OA using the Gold route is over 2.5 times higher than Green. Costs are then modeled at a national level using recent UK policy initiatives from Research Councils UK and the Higher Education Funding Councils' Research Excellence Framework as case studies. The study also demonstrates that the costs of complying with research funders' OA policies are considerably higher than where an OA publication is left entirely to authors' discretion. Key target areas for future efficiencies in the business processes are identified and potential cost savings calculated. The analysis is designed to inform ongoing policy development at the institutional and national levels.},

The first group of target papers were blogged, and the blogs were systematically tweeted. The second group of connected control papers were nonblogged papers that we carefully matched for author, topic, and year of publication. The third group were papers by different staff members on a variety of topics-Unrelated Control Papers. The results suggest an effect of social media on download rate, which was limited not just to Target Papers but also generalized to Connected Control Papers. Unrelated Control Papers showed no increase over the same amount of time (main effect of time, F(1,27) = 55.6, p {\textless} .001); Significant Group x Time Interaction, F(2,27) = 7.9, p = .002). The effect on citation rates was less clear but followed the same trend. The only predictor of the 2015 citation rate was downloads after blogging (r = 0.450, p = .012). These preliminary results suggest that promotion of academic articles via social media may enhance download and citation rate and that this has implications for impact strategies.},

The results revealed a clear difference in the evolution of scientific studies by species and by countries. The analysis comparisons showed the intensity of certain topics by species with the emergence of new ones, the economic impact on sciences and the increased support of conservation plan management for certain species, such as salmon and lamprey in France. This study also emerged that French research is not always consistent with the international trend which suggests the dominance of management systems on scientific studies.},

	abstract = {Research on aquaculture is expanding along with the exceptional growth of the sector and has an important role in supporting even further the future developments of this relatively young food production industry. In this paper we examined the aquaculture literature using bibliometrics and computational semantics methods (latent semantic analysis, topic model and co-citation analysis) to identify the main themes and trends in research. We analysed bibliographic information and abstracts of 14,308 scientific articles on aquaculture recorded in Scopus. Both the latent semantic analysis and the topic model indicate that the broad themes of research on aquaculture are related to genetics and reproduction, growth and physiology, farming systems and environment, nutrition, water quality, and health. The topic model gives an estimate of the relevance of these research themes by single articles, authors, research institutions, species and time. With the co-citation analysis it was possible to identify more specific research fronts, which are attracting high number of co-citations by the scientific community. The largest research fronts are related to probiotics, benthic sediments, genomics, integrated aquaculture and water treatment. In terms of temporal evolution, some research fronts such as probiotics, genomics, sea-lice, and environmental impacts from cage aquaculture, are still expanding while others, such as mangroves and shrimp farming, benthic sediments, are gradually losing weight. While bibliometric methods do not necessarily provide a measure of output or impact of research activities, they proved useful for mapping a research area, identifying the relevance of themes in the scientific literature and understanding how research fronts evolve and interact. By using different methodological approaches the study is taking advantage of the strengths of each method in mapping the research on aquaculture and showing in the meantime possible limitations and some directions for further improvements.},

Research output on the species is quantified and compared with research on four other whale species. The results show a significant increase in research for all species except the sei whale. Research output is characterized chronologically and by oceanic basin. 2 The species' distribution, movements, stock structure, feeding, reproduction, abundance, acoustics, mortality and threats are reviewed for the North Atlantic, and the review is complemented with previously unpublished data. 3 Knowledge on the distribution and movements of the sei whale in the North Atlantic is still mainly derived from whaling records. Movement patterns and winter distribution are not clear. Surveys in some known summering areas show that the species has changed its distribution in parts of its previously known range. 4 With the present information, it is impossible to determine whether or not the North Atlantic sei whale population is subdivided into biological units. Abundance estimates are fragmentary and cover a restricted part of the summering habitat. 5 In the North Atlantic, sei whales seem to be stenophagous, feeding almost exclusively on calanoid copepods and euphausiids. On feeding grounds, they are associated with oceanic frontal systems, but how they find and explore these structures has not been fully investigated. 6 The available data on vital rates are based on whaling-derived studies and are 25 years old or older. Despite increasing human and environmentally induced pressures, there are no current estimates for mortality and population trends. 7 Current research needs include the clear definition of stock units, reliable abundance estimates, studies of distribution and migration that incorporate the identification of wintering areas, acquisition of up-to-date data on reproduction and mortality, and investigations into the consequences of environmental changes for the species.},

These fisheries are recognized for its chronic lack of data and incipient knowledge when compared to large-scale fisheries, despite its socioeconomic and food security relevance. Brazil is a good model of small-scale freshwater fisheries country because it shares similar characteristics and shortcomings of many other countries in South America, Africa and Asia, where these activities prevail. This work aims to carry out a broad and comprehensive analysis of the approaches and limitations of Brazilian freshwater fisheries studies through a scientometric analysis. We conducted an exhaustive survey of scientific platforms such as the Web of Knowledge Thomson Reuters (ISI), Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), Google Scholar and CNPq Lattes Curriculum Vitae Database. We found that the platforms ISI and SciELO were limited for this area of knowledge as they recovered only 47 \% of the 186 studies reviewed. Brazilian freshwater fisheries studies were published in 72 journals and were conducted by 234 researchers, with very few specialists. On average the data processing into scientific information took 5 years, and half of the studies were conducted in short time scale (less than 2 years long) mostly by research institutions and universities. The number studies declined since the year 2008, after the creation of the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquiculture, which indicate that the fallacy of disregarding scientific knowledge may be permeating decision making agencies as already happen in the past in Brazil. The combination of these factors may cause slow and inefficient decision-making and management based on the best available science. Our results also highlighted the importance of multidisciplinarity in the training of human resources to work in the fishing sector.},

This analysis attempts to demonstrate the bibliometric impact of properly curated and openly accessible data sets by attempting to generate citation counts for three data sets archived at the National Oceanographic Data Center. My findings suggest that all three data sets are highly cited, with estimated citation counts in most cases higher than 99\% of all the journal articles published in Oceanography during the same years. I also find that methods of citing and referring to these data sets in scientific publications are highly inconsistent, despite the fact that a formal citation format is suggested for each data set.

In the context of this special issue commemorating the 100th anniversary of Hjort's seminal publication, our objective is to provide insights into how his work has penetrated the literature and influenced the development of fishery science. We also tracked Hjort's related article, "Fluctuations in the year classes of important food fishes" (Hjort, 1926). We present the citation life cycles of these articles and analyse various characteristics of the publications that cite them. The importance of Hjort (1914) is reflected in the large number of citations that it has accrued (908), and by the 40-50 citations that it continues to receive every year. This is exceptional for a 100-year-old scientific article, in any field. Hjort (1926) initially received as many cites as Hjort (1914), but the latter subsequently became the paradigmatic article. Hjort (1914) has been cited in 162 different journals and by scientists in 53 countries-Hjort's work has had a broad and global impact on fisheries research. The contextual analysis demonstrated that Hjort (1914) is considered a seminal, novel, and paradigm setting study-the core research questions addressed by Hjort (1914) remain unsolved and several of his hypotheses continue to drive fisheries science to this day.},

	abstract = {In 1981, James R. Karr's paper 'Assessment of biotic integrity using fish communities' provided the first description of a multimetric procedure to assess the biotic integrity of aquatic ecosystems. To assess the contribution of the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) and ideas proposed by Karr for the management of aquatic ecosystems, we carried out a scientometric analysis of the papers published from 1981 to 2011 that cited Karr's study. The papers were obtained from Thomson Reuters' database (ISI Web of Knowledge) in October 2011. We used all papers that cited 'Karr, 1981' to assess temporal trends in citations and to identify which journals cited the index most frequently. A total of 93 papers were selected from the two journals that most frequently cited Karr's study, namely Hydrobiologia and Ecological Indicators. For each paper selected, we determined whether the study was empirical, theoretical, or methodological. For empirical papers we assessed the type of environment where the study was carried out, the indicator organisms used, and whether the IBI was applied. To identify which ideas suggested by Karr have been discussed in the literature, we assessed all papers found. In the time frame studied, 734 papers cited 'Karr, 1981'. The number of citations increased significantly with time. Most papers that cited 'Karr, 1981' were empirical, carried out in rivers and streams, and used fish as bioindicators. The main ideas discussed in these studies were related to the creation and use of the IBI, as well as to limitations and difficulties in its application. Our results suggest that the ideas proposed by Karr have contributed to the conservation of aquatic ecosystems. However, criteria for choosing different metrics, as well as the definition of reference conditions, are issues that need to be addressed in order to make the IBI a more robust index.

Geosciences multidisciplinary, oceanography, ecology, meteorology and atmospheric sciences and geography physical were the most popular subject categories. Among the 20 major journals related to Antarctic research, Polar Biology, Geophysical Research Letters and Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres ranked as the top three. With the largest quantity of articles and high citations, USA was the leading contributor to global Antarctic research and had a dominant position in collaborative networks. In addition, a keywords analysis determined that climate change, sea ice and krill were the topics that generated the most interest and concern.

Moreover, this article presents a ten year appraisal (since the creation of RAMS). This appraisal first focuses on RAMS bibliometrics. We observed that RAMS was cited (Google Scholar) in 50 distinct publications among which 32 were peer-reviewed in 18 different journals. Three journals (Antarctic Science, Polar Biology, ZooKeys) represent almost 40\% of these peer-review publications. The second appraisal focuses on the evolution of new RAMS records. We observed an important decrease in data additions since 2011. As a case study, we focused on an original dataset for a specific group (Asteroidea, Echinodermata). It appears that around one hundred species of asteroids are lacking in RAMS despite the relatively high availability of these data. This suggests that the users' community (or collaborative projects such as AquaRES) could be helpful in order to maintain the RAMS database over the long term.},

The results confirmed that research on PCFH is becoming a notable area of interest. Current research emphases of PCFH are fish-habitat relationship and fish production, aquaculture techniques and fishery products, habitat conservation and fishery management, and climate change. Furthermore, six key areas of future research directions on PCFH were identified, namely: theoretical and technological basis, PCFH content, driving factors, calculation methods, ecosystem management and conservation strategies, and aquaculture. Moreover, it was suggest that a food web perspective should be considered in future fish habitat management and decision-making research. Basic data collection on fish and habitat is very urgent and important, and restoring the ecological function of fish habitats and damaged biological communities also represent important topics for future PCFH studies.},

Underwater noise from shipping is increasingly recognized as a significant and pervasive pollutant with the potential to impact marine ecosystems on a global scale. We reviewed six regional case studies as examples of recent research and management activities relating to ocean noise in a variety of taxonomic groups, locations, and approaches. However, as no six projects could ever cover all taxa, sites and noise sources, a brief bibliometric analysis places these case studies into the broader historical and topical context of the peer-reviewed ocean noise literature as a whole. The case studies highlighted emerging knowledge of impacts, including the ways that non-injurious effects can still accumulate at the population level, and detailed approaches to guide ocean noise management. They build a compelling case that a number of anthropogenic noise types can affect a variety of marine taxa. Meanwhile, the bibliometric analyses revealed an increasing diversity of ocean noise topics covered and journal outlets since the 1940s. This could be seen in terms of both the expansion of the literature from more physical interests to ecological impacts of noise, management and policy, and consideration of a widening range of taxa. However, if our scientific knowledge base is ever to get ahead of the curve of rapid industrialization of the ocean, we are going to have to identify naive populations and relatively pristine seas, and construct mechanistic models, so that we can predict impacts before they occur, and guide effective mitigation for the most vulnerable populations.

The countries with the highest impact were the UK, Norway, Germany, France, Canada, and Italy. We further assessed the research topics that are most commonly studied and attempt to understand what drives that. During the past three decades, research appears to have shifted from a focus on species-related questions to processes. An analysis of how publication output is distributed at the level of fish species indicates that a small number of species (e.g. Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout, and Atlantic cod) account for a disproportionate volume of the total research effort. Interestingly, publication output is not correlated with the commercial importance of a species. Although fisheries management is purportedly based upon scientific research, our analysis reveals that hardly any research at all is conducted on several of the (commercially) most important species, at least as measured by articles appearing in international scientific journals.},

Moreover, most artisanal fisheries in the Global South are unregulated and unmonitored and are in urgent need of science-based management to ensure future sustainability.

We examined factors hypothesized to explain variation in 5 author-based performance metrics among 437 fisheries and wildlife faculty from 33 research-extensive universities in the United States. Regression analyses revealed that the elapsed number of years since conferral of the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree (academic age) was a strong predictor of performance metrics, with non-linear age effects for Hirsch's h-index, Brown's h(b)-index, the annual rate of increase in h (i.e., m quotient), and number of publications. Greater performance was observed for faculty with greater research appointments. Performance did not vary between Wildlife and Fisheries disciplines but did vary across sub-disciplines; metrics indicated that genetics and disease-related sub-disciplines had the greatest positive effect sizes, social sciences and management-oriented sub-disciplines had the smallest effects, and ecology, conservation, quantitative methods, and aquatic science showed intermediate effect sizes. On average, male faculty published more articles than females, but no sex differences were evident for the other 4 performance metrics. Earlier publication relative to attainment of the Ph.D. degree (publication precocity) was associated with performance for all metrics. Regression models explained 28-54\% of the deviance and may prove useful in placing reported values for performance in context of performance by peers. As an alternative point of reference, named (i.e., distinguished) faculty on average exhibited performance 31-96\% greater than the performance predicted for otherwise comparable faculty. Our regression models allow for more meaningful comparison of publication and citation performance relative to peers, but they represent only one aspect of faculty performance and should not replace qualitative peer review of productivity and impact.

	abstract = {We identify the 199 most-cited fisheries references up to July 2014, topped by Nelson's Fishes of the World. Few book chapters, databases or reports were included, but review articles and field guides were over-represented. Publishing in Science, Nature or Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA is associated with a 34-fold increase in the probability of an article being highly cited, but many highly cited references were also published in journals with impact factors under eight. Proportional contributions to references, taking into account number of authors, author order and other key factors, revealed Bill Ricker and John Roland Brett as the greatest individual contributors, and the US, Canada and the UK as greatest country contributors, with Canada significantly over-represented. Female representation on the list was historically low before increasing to 21\% in the 1990s, and reflected gender changes in the field of fisheries. When compared to {\textgreater}2000 control papers published in the same journal and year, highly cited fisheries papers were significantly longer (20.4 vs. 9.8 pages) and had more authors (5.8 vs. 4.3), references (118 vs. 51), tables and total illustrations; these differences were greater when high-profile general journals were excluded, but lower when calculated on a per-page basis. References with more than six authors jumped from 0 to 27\% in 2000, coinciding with a rapid uptake of email among fisheries scientists. Overall, we find no shortcut to publishing highly cited references: they require substantial time, effort and knowledge invested in new hypotheses, textbooks, field guides, new discoveries, broad meta-analyses, new methods and reviews.},

Additionally, the water environment provides habitats for numerous species and plays an important role in hydrological, nutrient, and carbon cycles. Among the existing natural resources on Earth's surface, water is the most extensive as it covers more than 70\% of the Earth. To gather a comprehensive understanding of the focus of past, present, and future directions of remote sensing water research, we provide an alternative perspective on water research using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery by conducting a comparative quantitative and qualitative analysis of research development, current hotspots, and future directions using a bibliometric analysis. Our study suggests that there has been a rapid growth in the scientific outputs of water research using MODIS imagery over the past 15 years compared to other popular satellites around the world. The analysis indicated that Remote Sensing of Environment was the most active journal, and "remote sensing," "imaging science photographic technology," "environmental sciences ecology," "meteorology atmospheric sciences," and "geology" are the top 5 most popular subject categories. The Chinese Academy of Sciences was the most productive institution with a total of 477 papers, and Hu CM (Chinese) was the most productive author with 76 papers. A keyword analysis indicated that "vegetation index," "evapotranspiration," and "phytoplankton" were the most active research topics throughout the study period. In addition, it is predicted that more attention will be paid to research on climate change and phenology in the future. Based on the keyword analysis and in consideration of current environmental problems, more studies should focus on the following three aspects: (1) develop methods suitable for data assimilation to fully explain climate or phenological phenomena at continental or global scales rather than at local scales; (2) accurately predict the effect of global change and human activities on evapotranspiration and the water cycle; and (3) determine the evolutionary process of the water environment (i.e., water quality, macrophytes, cyanobacteria, etc.), ascertaining its dominant factors and driving mechanisms. By focusing on these three aspects, researchers will be able to provide timely monitoring and evaluation of water quality and its response to global change and human activities.},

To understand the global research profile and fronts of river phytoplankton, 13,434 publications regarding river phytoplankton indexed by Web of Science during 1991-2016 were analyzed using a bibliometric approach. The EU Water Framework Directive presents a good case for promoting not only frequent cooperation between European countries but also the development of river phytoplankton studies. Such directives are anticipated to promote global consistency of the water evaluations and management in the future. Phytoplankton play important roles in bio-assessments and energy flow of river ecosystems. The trait-based method has many advantages compared with traditional methods based on community composition and metric indices. The trait-based method considers a complex mixture of stressors by combining qualitative and quantitative parameters but also transfers different geographic taxonomic compositions to a similar complement of traits. Moreover, phytoplankton-based food chains are generally considered to transfer energy and carbon more efficiently to higher trophic levels than bacterial-based food chains. Algae are a high-quality food for higher trophic levels, compared with bacteria and terrestrial material. The algal component of periphyton has been demonstrated to be the major basal component of stream food webs.},

Fifty-two publications matched the search criteria (articles and conference papers with OL as part of title, keywords and/or abstract). Analysed parameters included the document types, publishing outlets, authors, countries, institutes, author keywords and title words. The term OL in scientific publications has been quantitatively dominated by the United States of America (USA), followed by the United Kingdom (UK) and Canada. The UK and Italy were the countries with the most international collaborative publications on this theme. In addition, the UK was the country that established the most international collaborations. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was the most productive institution and the Proceedings of the MTS/IEEE OCEANS 2005 was the publishing outlet containing the most publications. The analysis has also revealed the intrinsic link between science and OL, the use of questionnaires to evaluate the level of citizens' knowledge, values and awareness about marine issues, and the emphasis placed on educational approaches to improve OL.},

This growth in the literature has not only added an enormous number of dimensions to the SaW debate, but the sheer scale of the expansion has challenged researchers to be able to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the available SaW indicators. In this work, we have proposed a hybrid method comprised of sophisticated scientometric analysis to summarise scientific developments in the massive text corpus of the SaW literature in conjunction with a more traditional literature review to categorise the fuzzy' details that remain. Scientometric analysis highlights that the developed OECD countries play a vital role in the development and applications of SaW indicators and we describe key developments in this regard via a range of graphical approaches. Using an extensive collection of existing SaW indicators, the analysis is then summarised in a matrix of ranked indicators which serve as a powerful tool to compare, contrast, filter and select indicators for SaW assessment with minimum redundancies between indicators. The approach undertaken in this study is intended to be flexible and can be extended and applied to other fields of research.},

Meanwhile, the very recent notion of "blue growth" and the significant development potential related to marine environments have gained more and more concern for policy makers on different scales. It is therefore interesting to assess the academic research related to marine issues, owing to its potential contribution to this dynamics growth through knowledge transfers and academic spillovers. This paper provides a global evaluation of the marine academic production, using a spatialized, open and transdisciplinary approach. In particular, this approach is to mobilize indicators to assess scientific production, transpose it to the territorial scale and make a global comparison of "research territories" in the case of marine science, with a specific focus on European cities. The results show that the five main centres are Tokyo (Japan), Paris (France), San Diego (USA), Moscow (Russia) and Woods Hole (USA). A dense European territorial coverage in marine science centres also appears, and new world major centres such as Chinese and Brazilian ones emerge.},

The studies are mainly aimed at fisheries ecology, resource management, stock assessment and fish quality and are mostly (55.3\%) based on up to three years of sampling. The considerable presence of artisanal fisheries along the Brazilian coast, the difficulty of monitoring this fishery, and the wide variety of common names that in the absence of taxonomic resolution are inserted in landings data make it impossible to identify which stocks are effectively exploited, limit the use of fish-catch data, and result in fewer fisheries studies.},

The results indicate that coastal management research has increased significantly over time. The emergence of the topic in scholarly work coincides with passage of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (US Public Law 92-583), and increases in productivity can often be tied to the passage of important legislation or the publication of major policy documents for action on coastal issues. Social network analyses (SNA) indicate loosely connected networks of researchers and institutions, with highly collaborative subgroups that have a significant impact on the field. SNA results also highlight the importance of federal governments and international organizations in driving research and encouraging integrated management. The results indicate that the discipline is evolving to focus more on cross boundary management strategies, systems perspectives, and consideration of both marine and terrestrial environments.},

An analysis of Twitter may, therefore, give insights into why particular events resonate with the population. This article reports a study of a month of English Twitter posts, assessing whether popular events are typically associated with increases in sentiment strength, as seems intuitively likely. Using the top 30 events, determined by a measure of relative increase in (general) term usage, the results give strong evidence that popular events are normally associated with increases in negative sentiment strength and some evidence that peaks of interest in events have stronger positive sentiment than the time before the peak. It seems that many positive events, such as the Oscars, are capable of generating increased negative sentiment in reaction to them. Nevertheless, the surprisingly small average change in sentiment associated with popular events (typically 1\% and only 6\% for Tiger Woods' confessions) is consistent with events affording posters opportunities to satisfy pre-existing personal goals more often than eliciting instinctive reactions.},

	abstract = {Sentiment analysis is concerned with the automatic extraction of sentiment-related information from text. Although most sentiment analysis addresses commercial tasks, such as extracting opinions from product reviews, there is increasing interest in the affective dimension of the social web, and Twitter in particular. Most sentiment analysis algorithms are not ideally suited to this task because they exploit indirect indicators of sentiment that can reflect genre or topic instead. Hence, such algorithms used to process social web texts can identify spurious sentiment patterns caused by topics rather than affective phenomena. This article assesses an improved version of the algorithm SentiStrength for sentiment strength detection across the social web that primarily uses direct indications of sentiment. The results from six diverse social web data sets (MySpace, Twitter, YouTube, Digg, Runners World, BBC Forums) indicate that SentiStrength 2 is successful in the sense of performing better than a baseline approach for all data sets in both supervised and unsupervised cases. SentiStrength is not always better than machine-learning approaches that exploit indirect indicators of sentiment, however, and is particularly weaker for positive sentiment in news-related discussions. Overall, the results suggest that, even unsupervised, SentiStrength is robust enough to be applied to a wide variety of different social web contexts.},

Our results indicate that about 2\% of the overall population of scholars in the Web of Science is active on Twitter. By domain we find a strong presence of researchers from the Social Sciences and the Humanities. Natural Sciences is the domain with the lowest level of scholars on Twitter. Researchers on Twitter also tend to be younger than those that are not on Twitter. As this is a bibliometric-based approach, it is important to highlight the reliance of the method on the number of publications produced and tweeted by the scholars, thus the share of scholars on Twitter ranges between 1\% and 5\% depending on their level of productivity.

	abstract = {Although the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) is widely acknowledged to be a poor indicator of the quality of individual papers, it is used routinely to evaluate research and researchers. Here, we present a simple method for generating the citation distributions that underlie JIFs. Application of this straightforward protocol reveals the full extent of the skew of these distributions and the variation in citations received by published papers that is characteristic of all scientific journals. Although there are differences among journals across the spectrum of JIFs, the citation distributions overlap extensively, demonstrating that the citation performance of individual papers cannot be inferred from the JIF. We propose that this methodology be adopted by all journals as a move to greater transparency, one that should help to refocus attention on individual pieces of work and counter the inappropriate usage of JIFs during the process of research assessment.},

	abstract = {A new single-electron (SE) circuit mimicking the foraging behavior of a honeybee swarm is proposed. Recently, a "nature-inspired" or "biomimetic" technology has been attracting attention for developing innovative functional systems applying emerging nanoscale devices. In particular, the foraging behavior of honeybees is focused on as an architecture for a SE circuit. Honeybees show two foraging behaviors, namely, a probability search and a "waggle dance" (sharing information). By combining these behaviors, it can be considered that the foraging behavior is a unique information-processing act. For constructing a new system, a SE circuit mimicking the behavior was designed, constructed, and simulated. The SE circuit was constructed by assuming that the information that honeybees share corresponds to the operation of the circuit. The results of the simulation confirmed that the SE circuit mimics the information-sharing behavior of honeybees. Namely, the proposed honeybee-inspired SE circuit can perform functional information processing. (C) 2017 The Japan Society of Applied Physics},

	abstract = {A study concerning time-temperature information sharing behavior in the one-step forward chilled and frozen food supply chains was conducted. We mailed 1774 questionnaires to food manufacturing companies in Taiwan with a response rate of 7.0\%. We showed that obtaining raw materials time-temperature information from suppliers was more difficult than obtaining processed food product information from food manufacturers. The determinant factors considered were also different. For sharing time temperature information on raw materials during distribution from suppliers to food manufacturers, the relative power of food manufacturers, business strategy, and raw material quality uncertainty were important. However, for sharing information on processed product during distribution from food manufacturers to buyers, only business strategy and processed product quality uncertainty were important. This implies that requesting information from suppliers requires more effort. In addition, when zooming in, we found that the time-temperature sharing strategies of companies differ in the subsectors. For instance, the chilled food sector has higher willingness to share time-temperature information than the frozen food sector. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Micro-blogging is a new social networking service (SNS) that can be viewed as an easily accessible, simplified blog. The simple and swift spread properties of micro-blogging make it different to the conventional SNS. However, little empirical results were provided in prior literature to elaborate individual's behavior of micro-blogging use. Consequently, this study aims to explore the possible influence of individuals' motivations on their self-disclosure and instant information sharing behavior as well as the extent of perceived social support in micro-blogging. Individuals who had experiences on Plurk usage were invited as subjects. The partial least squares (PLS) was utilized to examine the proposed model and hypotheses. Analytical results indicate that popularity and interpersonal needs significantly influence individual's self-disclosure, while interpersonal and entertainment needs significantly influence individual's instant information sharing behavior. Moreover, both individual's self-disclosure and instant information sharing behavior have a positive relationship with the perceived extent of social support.},

This paper investigates different kinds of online information sharing behavior and analyzes the impact of demographic and Internet usage patterns on them. The results show that active sharing of socio-demographic information and control of passive information sharing by technical measures are the most frequently practiced types of online information sharing behavior. Internet usage intensity, Internet access by smart phone, and age largely influence active and passive information sharing behaviors whereas gender does not show a significant impact on online information sharing behavior.},

	abstract = {The rapid growth of social network data has given rise to high security awareness among users, especially when they exchange and share their personal information. However, because users have different feelings about sharing their information, they are often puzzled about who their partners for exchanging information can be and what information they can share. Is it possible to assist users in forming a partnership network in which they can exchange and share information with little worry? We propose a modified information sharing behavior prediction (ISBP) model that can help in understanding the underlying rules by which users share their information with partners in light of three common aspects: what types of items users are likely to share, what characteristics of users make them likely to share information, and what features of users' sharing behavior are easy to predict. This model is applied with machine learning techniques in WEKA to predict users' decisions pertaining to information sharing behavior and form them into trustable partnership networks by learning their features. In the experiment section, by using two real-life datasets consisting of citizens' sharing behavior, we identify the effect of highly sensitive requests on sharing behavior adjacent to individual variables: the younger participants' partners are more difficult to predict than those of the older participants, whereas the partners of people who are not computer majors are easier to predict than those of people who are computer majors. Based on these findings, we believe that it is necessary and feasible to offer users personalized suggestions on information sharing decisions, and this is pioneering work that could benefit college researchers focusing on user-centric strategies and website owners who want to collect more user information without raising their privacy awareness or losing their trustworthiness.},

A binary logistic regression analysis was employed to discover the impact of demographic characteristics, level of health literacy, and other factors on respondents' health information sharing behavior. Among the total 1,324 participants, 63.6\% share health information with others. Among all significant predictors, those who acquire health information via family and friends are 6.0 times the odds of sharing health information than those who do not. Participants who have more than six household members, with middle and high levels of health knowledge, and who are moderately involved in discussions or settlements of village affairs are also more likely to share health information. The reliance on interpersonal communication channels for health information, household size, the patients' preexisting health knowledge, and their activity in village affairs are crucial determinants for health information sharing among rural chronic patients. A more sophisticated model needs to be established to reveal the complex processes of health information communication.},

The study focuses on purchase decision pattern of young travelers by examining the travel decision-making styles. Design/methodology/approach - The author has adopted the quantitative approach for the fulfillment of the objectives of the study. The exploratory method is used to get a better understanding of different concepts used in the study, Social Networking Sites and Decision-Making Style and Gen Y, and the primary information is collected from the structured questionnaire. Using travel decision-making style and gender as grouping variables, different tests were performed to test the hypothesis and to understand the influence of different travel decision-making style and gender on travel information share on SNS. Findings - The present study identifies the existing seven travel decision-making styles of Gen Y, which are Confused by over-choice, Habitual, Novelty seeker, Price conscious, Perfectionist high-quality conscious, Recreational and Impulsive. The results of the study reflect that confused by over-choice, habitual, perfectionist, price conscious travel dimensions have an association with SNS for travel information share. In addition, gender also has an association with usages of SNS for travel information share. Research limitations/implications - This study has only used consumer typology approach to study decision-making styles, whereas other variables like personality and attitude can be further studied. Second, the study is limited by the spatiotemporal limitation, as the study is just restricted to one geographical area and time, and generalizations can vary with the change in spatiotemporal features in the study. Practical implications - The findings of the study imply that Gen Y is an important travel market segment, and to cater this segment, SNS can be used as an effective marketing tool. The study of various segments in different groups will help in understanding the market more clearly and using SNS more effectively. In addition, finding association of travel decision-making style with SNS helps in forming effective and innovative marketing strategies. Originality/value - India is a developing country where many market segments are still unexplored and Gen Y is being one of them. The study was conducted, keeping in mind the need of tourism industry. The study explores the tourism market segment of Gen Y by identifying the decision-making style and also identifies the association of different decision-making style with Gen Y information-sharing behavior on social networking site.},

Study 1 considered dyadic negotiations in which negotiators have symmetric or asymmetric best alternatives to the negotiated agreement (BATNAs). It also examined the impacts of (a) symmetry and knowledge of a counterpart's BATNA on agreement efficiency (indexed by joint gains), and how knowledge alters negotiators' realised power (indexed by percentage of resource claimed) in BATNA-asymmetric negotiations. Studies 2 and 3 focussed on BATNA-asymmetric negotiations. Study 2 tested the mechanism by which knowledge affects efficiency. Study 3 considered the impacts of knowledge on equity concerns, perceived power and information exchange about preferences. The findings indicate the following: knowledge of BATNA asymmetries (rather than the existence of BATNA asymmetries) adversely affects agreement efficiency; this knowledge increases strong negotiators' focus on value claiming, judgement errors about counterparts' preferences, perceived power and realised power, but impedes their information-sharing behaviour about preferences. Their focus on value claiming mediates the relationship between knowledge and judgement errors, whereas judgement errors mediate the relationship between their focus on value claiming and agreement efficiency. Furthermore, knowledge of BATNA asymmetries leads to contrasting perceptions of fairness. Strong negotiators with knowledge believe that a fair agreement should reflect their power advantage; weak negotiators generally tend to judge fairness based on equality. Counterintuitively, knowing one's own strengths can lead to 'winning' a meagre prize and neglecting the opportunity for value creation by trading-off on negotiated issues.},

	abstract = {Trust is often posited to substitute for management control in interfirm transactions. However, this raises questions of how trust arises in new relationships, and whether trust that is not based on prior experience transacting together is sufficient to persuade managers to forgo investments in management controls. We use an experiment to test whether two features of the early stage of an interfirm relationship influence a buyer's initial trust in a supplier and have consequences for subsequent investments in management controls and in the collaboration. These two features are the autonomy of the buyer's manager to choose a supplier (i.e., delegation of decision-making authority) and the supplier's willingness to share information with the buyer. We find that the buyer manager's initial trust in the supplier is associated positively with both the autonomy to choose the supplier and the supplier's willingness to share information. Information content and supplier characteristics are held constant, so these results are novel and distinct from prior studies of the antecedents of trust. We find that higher initial trust is associated with reduced expenditures for management controls and increased investments in the collaboration. Thus, we conclude that delegation of decision-making authority and supplier information-sharing behavior in the early stages of a relationship influence the formation of initial trust, which has real consequences for investments in management control and in the collaboration.},

We first analyze the information sharing incentives of a manufacturer and retailer in a bilateral monopoly and identify the importance of quality of information available with the firms and the degree of complementarity of resources in determining the effectiveness of information sharing.

	abstract = {In the research field of geographic information sharing, the current main research gap identified is that studies on individual and organizational behavior of geographic information sharing are still in its infancy. In order to research geographic information sharing in different cultural backgrounds from behavioral perspective, the geographic information sharing behavior model developed by Omran et al, 2007 is introduced. This model incorporates Hofstede's cultural dimensions and motivational factors for describing cross-cultural geographic information sharing. The relations in the model are formulated in the form of 23 hypotheses. Under the supports of the China Association for Geographic Information System(CAGIS), a formal questionnaire survey has been conducted in many Chinese departments relating to geographic information collection, management and application. Combing with Omran's empirical research, a comparative research in different cultural backgrounds is made since China, Egypt and the Netherlands respectively have different cultures. The results provide support for most of the proposed hypotheses, emphasizing the role of cultural differences and motivational factors on the individual and organizational geographic information sharing, and also realize that the geographic information sharing model can be applied in other countries, both developed and developing. The comparison of different national cultures for geographic information sharing would provide useful input for the further development of the geographic information sharing environment. Based on the quantitative results of the empirical research and China's actual situation, some policy suggestions that aim for advancing construction of geographic information sharing environment in China are put forward.},

It is expected that there will be areas where the information sharing practices of the Millennials will differ from those of older generations. This mismatch is likely to mean that systems designed for and by older workers will cause tensions and contradictions in the information sharing practice of the Millennials. Conclusions.

	abstract = {In political contexts, it is known that people act as "motivated reasoners", i.e., information is evaluated first for emotional affect, and this emotional reaction influences later deliberative reasoning steps. As social media becomes a more and more prevalent way of receiving political information, it becomes important to understand more completely the interaction between information, emotion, social community, and information-sharing behavior. In this paper, we describe a high-precision classifier for politically-oriented tweets, and an accurate classifier of a Twitter user's political affiliation. Coupled with existing sentiment-analysis tools for microblogs, these methods enable us to systematically study the interaction of emotion and sharing in a large corpus of politically-oriented microblog messages, collected from just before the 2012 US presidential election. In particular, we seek to understand how information sharing is influenced by the political affiliation of the sender and receiver of a message, and the sentiment associated with the message.},

Information is a resource that should be aligned with an organization business's objectives in order to gain benefits for the organization. Information need to be shared among employees who can make profitable use of it. However, employees seldom share information or would rather keep the information to themselves unless it is requested from them. Data collected from 817 respondents were analyzed using structural equation modeling technique (SEM). Research results indicate that job satisfaction and individual sharing attitude do not influence the individual cognitive attributes. Results also indicate that individual cognitive attributes mediate the relation between leadership, job characteristics, and organizational structure with individual information sharing behavior.},

	abstract = {Numerous surveys have shown that Web users are concerned about the loss of privacy associated with online tracking. Alarmingly, these surveys also reveal that people are also unaware of the amount of data sharing that occurs between ad exchanges, and thus underestimate the privacy risks associated with online tracking. In reality, the modern ad ecosystem is fueled by a flow of user data between trackers and ad exchanges. Although recent work has shown that ad exchanges routinely perform cookie matching with other exchanges, these studies are based on brittle heuristics that cannot detect all forms of information sharing, especially under adversarial conditions. In this study, we develop a methodology that is able to detect client-and server-side flows of information between arbitrary ad exchanges. Our key insight is to leverage retargeted ads as a tool for identifying information flows. Intuitively, our methodology works because it relies on the semantics of how exchanges serve ads, rather than focusing on specific cookie matching mechanisms. Using crawled data on 35,448 ad impressions, we show that our methodology can successfully categorize four different kinds of information sharing behavior between ad exchanges, including cases where existing heuristic methods fail. We conclude with a discussion of how our findings and methodologies can be leveraged to give users more control over what kind of ads they see and how their information is shared between ad exchanges.},

In individual-level, personal social skill has positive relationship with information-sharing behavior. Personal behavior of knowledge collecting is positively related to innovative performance. In team-level, when team members commonly perceived the importance of knowledge network in achieving team's goals, individuals are more likely to display the behavior of knowledge-sharing. Information-sharing climate of a team has significant and positive impact on member's knowledge collecting behavior.

	abstract = {Based on the curricula vitae and survey responses of 443 academic scientists affiliated with university research centers in the USA, we examine the longstanding assumption that research collaboration has a positive effecton publishing productivity. Since characteristics of the individual and the work environment are endogenously related to both collaboration and productivity, this study focuses on the mediating effect of collaboration on publishing productivity. By using the two-stage least squares analysis, the findings indicate that in the presence of moderating variables such as age, rank, grant, gender, marital status, family relations, citizenship, job satisfaction, perceived discrimination, and collaboration strategy, the simple number ('normal count') of peer-reviewed journal papers is strongly and significantly associated with the number of collaborators. However, the net impacts of collaboration are less clear. When we apply the same model and examine productivity by 'fractional count', dividing the number of publications by the number of authors, we find that number of collaborators is not a significant predictor of publishing productivity. In both cases, 'normal count' and 'fractional count', we find significant effects of research grants, citizenship, collaboration strategy, and scientific field. We believe that it is important to understand the effects of the individual and environmental factors for developing effective strategies to exploit the potential benefits.of collaboration. We note that our focus is entirely at the individual level, and some of the most important benefits of collaboration may accrue to groups, institutions, and scientific fields.},

Since this systematic bias in scientific information and recognition practices fits the second half of Matthew 13:12 in the Bible, which refers to the under-recognition accorded to those who have little to start with, it is suggested that sociologists of science and knowledge can add to the 'Matthew Effect', made famous by Robert K. Merton in 1968, the 'Matilda Effect', named for the American suffragist and feminist critic Matilda J. Gage of New York, who in the late nineteenth century both experienced and articulated this phenomenon. Calling attention to her and this age-old tendency may prod future scholars to include other such 'Matildas' and thus to write a better, because more comprehensive, history and sociology of science.

Concern over RMRs stems from public disillusionment with the promise of science, increased demands for accountability, \& the increased diversity of the research community \& likelihood of research disputes. Debate regarding application of RMRs centers on definitions of \& distinctions between fraud \& misconduct \& confusion over use of implicit standards of conduct, collegial control of research integrity, \& confrontational approaches to misconduct management.

Design: Semidirective interviews of senior clinical researchers. Setting: University hospital. Participants: Thirty-nine main investigators of clinical research programmes. Main measurements: Awareness and use of International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) criteria for authorship, and perceptions about ghost and gift authorship. Results: A total of 48 protocols submitted by 42 principal investigators between 1994 and 1996 were identified. Thirty-nine investigators were contacted; 37 (one of whom delegated a co-author) were interviewed between May 2002 and March 2003. Two co-authors of two principal investigators were also interviewed. In all, 42 studies were represented. The interviews lasted for 40–90 minutes and were conducted with openness and respect for confidentiality. The choice of names of co-authors did not follow the ICMJE recommendations. Half of the respondents stated they were aware of criteria for authorship and knew of ICMJE, but most of them did not cite any of the ICMJE criteria among those they applied in deciding authorship. Most of them disagreed with the obligation to meet the three criteria justifying co-authorship because they found these too rigid and inapplicable. Gift authorship was a common practice; 59\% of the respondents had been a recipient of gift authorship. Twenty-five (64\%) were aware of ghost authorship and the majority considered it questionable and blameworthy. Conclusions: The ICMJE criteria were ignored by clinicians at a university hospital. Ghost and gift authorship were frequent among them. There is a need for French guidelines for authorship to be prepared and implemented. CR - Copyright © 2005 BMJ},

This study investigates what characteristics of researchers are associated with disciplinary and interdisciplinary research collaborations and what collaborations are most rewarding in different scientific disciplines. Our results confirm that female scientists are more engaged in interdisciplinary research collaborations. Further, a scientist''s years of research experience are positively related with both types of collaboration. Work experience in firms or governmental organizations increases the propensity of interdisciplinary collaborations, but decreases that of disciplinary collaborations. Disciplinary collaborations occur more frequent in basic disciplines; interdisciplinary collaborations more in strategic disciplines. We also found that in both types of disciplines, disciplinary collaborations contribute more to career development than interdisciplinary collaborations. We conclude with three recommendations for science and innovation policy, while emphasising the need to distinguish between different scientific disciplines.

Keeping the application context constant, we focus on management science and find that only non-alpha numeric characters and a balanced title structure have small, but significant effects on citation count. Surprisingly, attributes which tended to show significant effects in other disciplines (though often in opposite directions), such as length, context, and linguistic attributes exhibited no relationship with citation count.},

This article compares the percentages of articles with co-authors in alphabetical order (alphabetization) for two-author, three-author and four-author articles in eighteen social sciences in 1995 and 2010 to assess how widespread this practice is. There is some degree of alphabetization in all disciplines except one but the level varies substantially between disciplines. This level is increasing slightly over time, on average, but it has increased substantially in a few disciplines and decreased in others, showing that the practice of alphabetization is not fading away. A high correlation between alphabetical order and the proportion of first authors near the beginning of the alphabet confirms that high percentages of alphabetical order could affect the appropriate allocation of research credit. Similar patterns were found for science and the humanities. Finally, since some degree of alphabetization is almost universal in social science disciplines, this practice may be affecting careers throughout the social sciences and hence seems indefensible.

There is an increasing focus in a number of countries on larger grant forms, such as centers of excellence, and in some cases also increases in the size of individual project grants. Among the rationales for this are economies of scale in research and redistribution of resources towards top researchers in order to increases scientific productivity and pathbreaking research. However, there may potentially also be negative impacts of increasing funding size, and there is limited empirical evidence on the actual consequences of increases in size. In this paper we critically examine the rationales behind increases in funding size and the empirical evidence on the impacts of size in research funding.

	abstract = {The authors examine the conditions prompting university‐employed life scientists to become entrepreneurs, defined to occur when a scientist (1) founds a biotechnology company, or (2) joins the scientific advisory board of a new biotechnology firm. This study draws on theories of social influence, socialization, and status dynamics to examine how proximity to colleagues in commercial science influences individuals’ propensity to transition to entrepreneurship. To expose the mechanisms at work, this study also assesses how proximity effects change over time as for‐profit science diffuses through the academy. Using adjusted proportional hazards models to analyze case‐cohort data, the authors find evidence that the orientation toward commercial science of individuals’ colleagues and coauthors, as well as a number of other workplace attributes, significantly influences scientists’ hazards of transitioning to for‐profit science.

Clinical research is typically performed by contract research organizations, analyzed by company statisticians, written up by independent medical writers, approved and edited by academic researchers who then serve as authors, and the whole process organized and shepherded through to journal publication by publication planners. This paper reports on a conference of an international association of publication planners. It describes and analyzes their work in an ecological framework that relates it to marketing departments of pharmaceutical companies, medical journals and publishers, academic authors, and potential audiences. The medical research described here forms a new kind of corporate science, designed to look like traditional academic work, but performed largely to market products.},

	title = {The use of bibliometrics for assessing research: {Possibilities}, limitations and adverse effects},
	isbn = {978-3-319-09785-5},
	abstract = {Researchers are used to being evaluated: publications, hiring, tenure and funding decisions are all based on the evaluation of research. Traditionally, this evaluation relied on judgement of peers but, in the light of limited resources and increased bureaucratization of science, peer review is getting more and more replaced or complemented with bibliometric methods. Central to the introduction of bibliometrics in research evaluation was the creation of the Science Citation Index (SCI) in the 1960s, a citation database initially developed for the retrieval of scientific information. Embedded in this database was the Impact Factor, first used as a tool for the selection of journals to cover in the SCI, which then became a synonym for journal quality and academic prestige. Over the last 10 years, this indicator became powerful enough to influence researchers' publication patterns in so far as it became one of the most important criteria to select a publication venue. Regardless of its many flaws as a journal metric and its inadequacy as a predictor of citations on the paper level, it became the go-to indicator of research quality and was used and misused by authors, editors, publishers and research policy makers alike. The h-index, introduced as an indicator of both output and impact combined in one simple number, has experienced a similar fate, mainly due to simplicity and availability. Despite their massive use, these measures are too simple to capture the complexity and multiple dimensions of research output and impact. This chapter provides an overview of bibliometric methods, from the development of citation indexing as a tool for information retrieval to its application in research evaluation, and discusses their misuse and effects on researchers' scholarly communication behavior.},

	abstract = {Part of a special issue on the voice in the human sciences.  The concepts of writing and authorship in Plato are related to monologism and absence rather than presence.  The Phaedrus opposes writing precisely insofar as it creates that unresponsive figure in the discursive field that has been termed the author.  The dialectical preference for question-and-answer is designed to prevent anything similar to an author from coming into the field of knowledge. However, the Platonic dialogues are divided in their signature between a Socrates who speaks and a Socrates who writes.  While the Platonic oeuvre grows, it shifts from graphic representation of the oral methods of Socrates to the status of a writing in its own terms.  The Phaedrus represents a vital statement in this cultural transition. Therefore, far from merely condemning writing, the dialogue accepts Plato's growth as an author of written compositions and his growing sense of himself as an author.},

Although few formal rules exist, it is clear that many scholars subscribe to the idea of a governing etiquette. The findings also suggest that acknowledgement data could be mined to lay bare the rules of engagement that define the dynamics of collaboration and inter‐dependence among scholars.},

	abstract = {Despite efforts to recruit and retain more women, a stark gender disparity persists within academic science. Abundant research has demonstrated gender bias in many demographic groups, but has yet to experimentally investigate whether science faculty exhibit a bias against female students that could contribute to the gender disparity in academic science. In a randomized double-blind study (n = 127), science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student—who was randomly assigned either a male or female name—for a laboratory manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. The gender of the faculty participants did not affect responses, such that female and male faculty were equally likely to exhibit bias against the female student. Mediation analyses indicated that the female student was less likely to be hired because she was viewed as less competent. We also assessed faculty participants’ preexisting subtle bias against women using a standard instrument and found that preexisting subtle bias against women played a moderating role, such that subtle bias against women was associated with less support for the female student, but was unrelated to reactions to the male student. These results suggest that interventions addressing faculty gender bias might advance the goal of increasing the participation of women in science.},

	abstract = {The era of post-war politics has come to an end in the wake of events in Central and Eastern Europe, the worldwide crisis of Marxism-Leninism, and the collapse of Communist systems since 1989. A new epoch of international relations has begun. One of the characteristic features of the politics of East-West confrontation was the phenomenon of nations divided between two camps: Germany, Korea, Vietnam and China. Even though the division of China can be viewed as the outcome of domestic strife, the fact remains that, by the beginning of the Korean War at the latest, both Chinese states had become frontline states in the East-West conflict. After the division of Vietnam had already been overcome following North Vietnam's victory in 1975 and German unification became reality after the accession of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) to the Federal Republic of Germany on 3 October 1990, the only divided nations left as the legacy of the postwar order were Korea and China. Following roughly 40 years of official non-relations, mainland China and Taiwan have developed a dynamic relationship during recent years. Eberhard Sandschneider, a recognised authority on Chinese politics and a scientific assistant at the China and East Asia Section of the University of Saarbruecken, examines this problem of politico-ideologically induced division with reference to the still topical example of China. The article is the shortened version of a paper which the author presented at the 2nd "German-Chinese Relations Past and Present" international conference held in Berlin between 22 and 27 July 1991.},

	title = {{SOME} {THEORETICAL} {QUESTIONS} {OF} {THE} {TRANSFORMATION}},
	volume = {41},
	issn = {0032-3233},
	abstract = {The paper attempts to present a partial theoretical generalization of empirical findings resulting from the transformation of the centrally planned economy of some post-totalitarian countries (especially Poland, Czechoslovakia, the former GDR and Hungary) into a market economy. It is based on the assessment that the unexpectedly sudden appearance of the transformation problem, as an urgent immediate task of practical economic policy, surprised economic science in the West as well as the East completely unprepared. There were some more or less erudite critical analyses of the functioning of centrally planned economics but, apart from some isolated exceptions, there did not exist any integrated, consistent and widly discussed programmes or scripts with a positive solution which could have helped the new leading personalities by offering at least in theoretical discussions (if not practical experience) tested starting points for the formulation and realization of a practical system-creating and regulative economic policy in the transformation process. That is why in the beginning we see quite some fumbling in the transformation activity of the 'post-totalitarian governments and their only clear point consists in the attempt to immitate rapidly the tried out ,,pattern'' or example of the developed western market economies. The approximately three years old empiric experiments of this effort proved how difficult, complicated and demanding in time the achievement of that goal is. The paper analyses mainly the problem of speed, length and character of the necessary transitory period, in which we still find the inherited mechanism of the old system superseded only to a limited extent by the gradually developing new mechanisms of the market economy. Confronting the transformation strategies selected especially in Poland, Czechoslovakia and the former GDR, the author arrives at the following conclusions: the speed and duration of the transformation depends mainly on the degree to which we are able to coordinate - right in the ''starting package'' - the creation of a commodity and service market (price liberalization and internal currency convertibility) with the proprietary transformation (capitalization and commercialization) of the state enterprises sector and to minimize the time difference between these mutually dependent and system-creating elements which a?e decisive for the start and function of the market mechanism; the quickest way of transforming property relations seems to be the combination-of a first-and-final complex denationalization (capitalization and commercialization) of state enterprises with their succeeding privatization by utilizing a broad scale of privatization methods; the parallel coming into being of a liberalized commodity and service market and start of the capital market as well as their integration based on enterprise capitalization, forms the system base permitting the restructuralization of effective demand from the-first market to transform gradually and by means of the capital market, into the restructuralization of effective supply resulting from the immanent economic interest of the enterprises (the existential necessity to raise the value and amount of the capital at their disposal); the system base for the application of a selective economic, mainly fiscal policy is developing simultaneously; - the foundation of a liberalized commodity and service market can overcome the ''permanent shortage'' of the centrally planned economy and establish a certain equilibrium between supply and demand. By itself it is, however, not strong enough to evoke in the economic mechanism impulses able to master the essentially lower production level. The pace of the revival and innovation of economic growth actually depends on the speed at which the,capital market originates and integrates as well as facilitates the reallocation of existing capital (by means of insolvencies and settlements) and especially the input and production of new capital. The second topic is an analysis of the reasons for the inertia of outdated behaviour stereotypes, especially in large enterprises, even after the liberalization of the commodity and service market. The author characterizes these stereotypes with his own expression of a reversed ''mini-max''. In such a case the enterprise maximizes the inputs and minimizes the outputs. That means that it behaves exactly contrary-wise to an authentic, fullvalued market subject. He sees the reason in the fact that the orientation towards direct privatization - be it with standard or non-standard methods (coupon privatization) - proved to be highly and unusually demanding on time. That is how a relatively long interval (in the CSFR more than two years) elapsed in which the state enterprises are still defined as organisational and not capital units. This is a period of so-called pre-privatization agony in which the not transformed state enterprises still behave according to the laws of the ''reversed mini-max'': they are in debt or even squander away their basic assets without any restructuralization to the conditions of a market economy. The paper introduced the reader to the alternative script of denationalization and capitalization of state enterprises as the first phase of their proprietary transformation previous to actual privatization.This not performed project of an expert team of the Czech government eleborated in 1990 (a similar method was chosen in the former GDR) had a chance to eliminate the preprivatization agony. The paper arives at the conclusion that privatization combined with previous denationalization and capitalization of state enterprises creates optimal conditions for the acceleration of the transformation in enterprise behaviour from the reversed mini-max to the normal market economy, because: it eliminates the ''dead period'' between establishing a state enterprise as an organisational and technological unit and its changing into a market - capital unit, i.e. realistically and strategically directed market subject; it frees the transformation process of the frustration resulting from the time challenge and other demands of an effective privatization process leading to the fabrication of problematical and empirically not verified ''non-standard'' methods (coupon privatization). the temporary synchronization of the origin and development of the commodity and service market on the one hand and the capital market on the other creates pre-requisites for the market (price) signals of the first one to be directly projected into the second one in order to influence actively the restructuralization of enterprises and the whole of the economy.},

Although the importance of the events is generally acknowledged, there is a comparative lack of clarity in political and historical sciences about the character of individual events and their typological assessment. This is particularly the case with respect to the upheaval in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR), which triggered the decisive elements of further change in Europe through German unification and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact. Hannelore Horn, Professor of International Politics and Eastern European Studies at the Free University of Berlin, sets out to clarify events in East Germany in 1989/90 in the light of revolution theory concepts.},

East Germany's transformation process was more profound and rapid than those in the other formerly communist countries: the difference lay in the fact hat it moved alongside a complete institutional model (the West German) which gave the process a clear direction. This paper briefly describes the transformation at an institutional level, but then focuses on a set of individual research organizations: the institutes of the old DDR Academy of Sciences. A constrained-choice model is used to explain the wide variety of transformation outcomes (dissolution or preservation). This analysis shows that the Academy's institutes were threatened to varying degrees by the turbulent changes in their environment; that various opportunities for strategic action were open to them; that they used these opportunities in different ways; and that these factors together can plausibly explain the outcomes of the transformation.},

It then deals with the theoretical challenges facing the group of scholars covering the topic of "politics and administration". Three aspects deserve special mention in this context. First, the tension between the theoretical eclecticism originating from the unexpectedness and speed of the 1989/90 transitions and the need to provide at least a minimal theoretical foundation for the work of the group had to be resolved. This was achieved in two ways: by using the conceptual distinction of functional analysis into the institutional (macro), intermediary (meso) and individual (micro) level of the political system, and by considering prior work which had originated from the study of transition from authoritarian rule. Secondly, it was clear from the outset that the reports of the working group could not exclusively rely on KSPW studies; this would have been a much too narrow base. Thirdly, the impetus needs to be highlighted to look as much as possible at the processual dimension of the GDR transition. Based on these general considerations, the article then sets out to present some of the findings from the work of the KSPW group on politics and administration.},

It is based on aggregate data and representative survey data of random samples of 2554 adults in both subsystems. Findings show that there were marked differences in life-expectancy prior to unification. The integration of the two systems, which occurred almost totally with regard to terms of West German health care organization, shows adjustment problems in the East for the public Health-Care-Funds and few if any for ambulatory care. The work situation has an impact on health, but there are no significant differences for East versus West. Social stratification variables show an influence on subjective health status for education (East) and for income, social status (West), while physician utilization (despite a preference of specialists by those with higher status) is not significantly determined by stratification variables in either East or West Germany. Beyond the central focus on work and stratification determinants a major finding pertains to a comparatively worse health situation for the aged and for women in what was the former East Germany. System models of Capitalism versus Socialism fit the results and recent history of the two systems to only a limited degree, as the West German corporate health system shows clear limits in following free market principles. The East German system, regardless of its centralized organization and move towards a socialist system, never fully abandoned the traditional model of German health care. Unlike the East German health system, that of West Germany, with its general expansion to 92\% of the population, shows an increasing effect for social redistribution. The latter may be a reason why standard indicators of social stratification show less of an impact on health and health care than expected, while conditions at work clearly determine the health of people-the latter being the case in both the former East and West Germany.

	abstract = {Results of a random survey of 2574 adults in East and West Germany in 1992 show virtually no differences in subjective health status for the populations of East versus West Germany and only slight differences for men versus women. A closer analysis via multiple regression indicates, however, that contrary to previous results from other countries West German women have a better health status than men. Of the four gender groups analyzed separately East German men are the best off, while owing to a number of socio-economic status discrepancies, East German women report the worst health status. Surprisingly, West German men show a poorer subjective health status than East German men, although a number of factors like participation in sport, better income and younger age would predict otherwise. It is suggested that their health situation is negatively influenced not only by their work situation but also by outside private commitments not accounted for in this analysis. Also difficult to explain from the present data is the relatively good health status of East German men. Despite an insecure job and a difficult work situation they may experience unification in sociopolitical terms and their present social status as something positive. Overall, conditions in the system of West Germany show a tendency to favor women, while those in East Germany clearly favor men. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	abstract = {Drawing on postcolonial theory and recent geographical debates on subaltern speech and marginal positioning this paper asks what the relevance of 'place' is for attempts to 'transgress' and 'resist' the marginalisation of (former) East Germans in (post)unification Germany. My intention is not to equate the postcolonial situation with that of East Germany after unification, but rather to engage the theoretical and political insights of postcolonial critiques to highlight the conflicts and contradictions that emerge from attempts to move 'beyond' oppressive binary constructions. Questions of speaking and listening, as well as seeing and being seen are attended to with a strong focus on the paradoxical places and spaces within which they come to matter in contradictory ways. How do the practices of listening/speaking, seeing/being-seen function to place particular groups in the social margin or centre of '(re)united' Germany? Does 'power' reside less with the speaker than with the listener, or is it still important to claim voice (rather than being 'given' voice) as an 'other'? The paper tries to work through some of the tensions, conflicts and concerns that have emerged from my PhD research on the construction of East German marginality through media practices, but also in German social, cultural, political and academic discourse. Perhaps the most significant of these conflicts is that of having lost one's politically bounded place (as a GDR citizen) and yet finding oneself reconstituted in the (symbolic as well as socio-economic and political) margin of a nation that, to this date, is described as 'divided within itself'. The sense of placelessness becomes politically relevant when 'resistant' or 'transgressive' acts are (to be) performed that have no 'proper' place from which to embark or in which to be staged. Similar to the post-colonial situation, where no 'original beyond' exists, and despite being frequently posited as a symbolically separate entity, 'East Germans' have no place for return, only an impossible situation of being constantly 'out-of-place' even in the locales that used to be 'home'.

The possible roles of lifestyles, knowledge about health and behaviour, emotional wellbeing and perceptions of control were assessed in a cross-sectional survey of young adults of similar educational status in Eastern and Western Europe. As part of the European Health and Behaviour Survey, data were collected in 1989-1991 from 4170 university students aged 18-30 years from Austria, Belgium, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland, and from 2293 students from the German Democratic Republic, Hungary and Poland. Measures were obtained of health behaviours, awareness of the role of lifestyle factors in health, depression., social support. health locus of control, and the value placed on health. After adjustment for age and sex, East European students had less healthy lifestyles than Western Europeans according to a composite index of 11 health behaviours, with significant differences for seven activities: regular exercise, drinking alcohol, avoiding dietary fat, eating fibre, adding salt to food, wearing a seat-belt, and using sunscreen protection. East European students were less likely to be aware of the relationship between lifestyle factors (smoking, exercise, fat and salt consumption) and cardiovascular disease risk. In addition, they were more depressed (adjusted odds of elevated scores on the Beck Depression Inventory of 2.46, 95\% C.I. 1.95-3.09). reported lower social support. and had higher beliefs in the "chance" and "powerful others" locus of control. Internal locus of control levels did not differ across regions, and Eastern Europeans placed a higher valuation on their health. Unhealthy lifestyles associated with lack of information about health and behaviour, greater beliefs in uncontrollable influences, and diminished emotional well-being, may contribute to poor health status in Eastern Europe.

The microeconometric structure of unemployment regression equations in the nations of eastern Europe appears to be similar to the industrialised A est. Estimation of cast European wage curves produces a local unemployment elasticity of between -0.1 and -0.3. This is somewhat larger in absolute terms than has been found elsewhere, On a variety of attitudinal measures, eastern Europeans said they were less contented than their western European counterparts. The strongest support for the changes that have occurred in eastern Europe is to be found among men, the young, the most educated, students, and the employed and particularly the self-employed.

Initially, many observers expected that the East Germans would quickly take advantage of their political, religious, and economic freedoms to become as entrepreneurial, partisan, and religious as their Western counterparts. Over the past decade, however, social scientists have discovered the persistence of 'Leninist legacies,' arguing that the East Europeans' socialization under communism will make them reluctant to act on the before-mentioned freedoms. Contrary to both of these expectations, we find considerable variation in the Easterners' behavior. In the economic sphere, while the Easterners have been willing to engage in legal market activity, they have been reluctant to get involved with gray market activity. In the political realm the elites have embraced partisan politics more thoroughly than have ordinary citizens. Finally, the Easterners have flocked neither to the Catholic and Protestant churches nor to new religious movements like Scientology. These results suggest that the combination of Western rights and Eastern Leninist legacies has created a unique incentive structure in East Germany. The Easterners face a different cost-benefit calculus than do the Westerners and, as a result, at times are less willing to act on their positive freedoms. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {The article tries to explain the social and political upheaval in the former GDR by using a theoretical model worked out by Pierre Bourdieu. Transition research within political science focuses mainly on the functional prerequisites necessary to liberalize and democratize authoritarian regimes. Bourdieu's model, however, also accounts for the historical events, the political actors and their actions, and the social and political mechanisms through which a rapid change can be realized. By applying this approach on the system's change in the GDR it is not only possible to determine the structural and functional conditions of the upheaval, but also to describe the concrete historical processes of how the upheaval took place. The approach used here is an attempt to mediate between 'agency' and 'structure' and thus to integrate historical argumentation into the theoretical framework provided by political science and sociology.

	abstract = {This paper assesses the impact of medical care on changes in mortality in east Germany and Poland before and after the political transition, with west Germany included for comparison. Building upon Rutstein's concept of unnecessary untimely deaths, we calculated the contribution of conditions considered responsive to medical care or health policy to changes in life expectancy between birth and age 75 [e((0-75))] for the periods 1980/1983-1988 and 1991/1992-1996/1997. Temporary life expectancy, between birth and age 75, has been consistently higher in west Germany, intermediate in east Germany and lowest in Poland. Although improving in all three regions between the early 1980s and the late 1990s, the pace of change differed between countries, resulting in a temporary widening of an initial cast-west gap by the late 1980s and early 1990s, In the 1980s, in east Germany, 50-60\% of the improvement was attributable to declining mortality from conditions responsive to medical care (west Germany: 30-40\%). A net positive effect was also observed in Poland, although counterbalanced by deterioration in ischaemic heart disease mortality. In the former communist countries, improvements attributable to medical care in the 1980s were due, largely, to declining infant mortality. In the 1990s, they benefited also adults, specifically those aged 35 + in Poland and 55 + in Germany. A persisting east-west gap in temporary life expectancy in Germany was due, largely, to higher mortality from avoidable conditions in the east, with causes responsive to health policy contributing about half, and medical care 16\% (men) to 24\% (women) to the differential in 1997. The findings indicate that changes in the health care system related to the political transition were associated with improvements in life expectancy in east Germany and, to a lesser extent, in Poland. Also, differences in the quality of medical care as assessed by the concept of 'unnecessary untimely deaths' appear to contribute to a persisting east-west health gap. Especially in Poland and the former German Democratic Republic there remains potential for further progress that would narrow the health gap with the west. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {The tendency to talk about Europe as a single unit needs to be modified in the light of different levels of development in both eastern and western parts of the continent. Information is an international commodity which knows no barriers and one essential method of communicating it is published materials of all kinds. No country can hope to be self-sufficient in provision of materials and cooperation is essential to meet the needs of users. This is one of the foundations of the concept of Universal Availability of Publications (UAP) promoted by IFLA. Although research shows that the majority of document supply requests are for Western European language journals in science and technology, other materials are also important. Because of the language factor, most Eastern European countries will always be net borrowers in international terms as most of their languages are not read extensively outside their own borders. Libraries in former socialist countries relied on major collections in the former Soviet Union and each other for supply but this is no longer possible for economic and political reasons. Most supplying libraries in the region now require payment in hard currency and the former GDR, which was also a major source of document supply, now takes a unified approach reflecting the practices of the former Federal Republic. Alternative sources of supply are expensive and require appropriate currency which is not available. Networking is essential for locating and supplying materials but can frustrate the user when bibliographic expectations cannot be transformed into document supply realisations. There are many rich and valuable collections in the region which are still largely unknown. Printed guides may exist but increasingly there is a need for in-depth analysis of collections and the information to be made available through electronic networks. Research in Poland has highlighted this problem. Research is cited to show that retrospective conversion of catalogues generates additional demand through interlibrary loan networks. As libraries in Eastern Europe are linked to wide networks and their catalogues automated there will be an increase in demand on them for document supply which may generate some additional revenue to buy into expensive systems to meet their own needs. The voucher scheme, being developed by IFLA, may provide some relief from these problems. Financial arrangements need to be reorganised to allow suppliers to benefit from the revenue they may generate. As electronic document delivery grows in importance there will be greater demand for this which will be limited not so much by technology as by copyright law. Governments need to take a lead in reshaping attitudes to intellectual property, telecommunications and the provision of information on a national basis. In the end the value of networking must be tested against the criteria established to justify its use. Unless purpose is properly defined disappointment will follow: proper planning will generate success.},

In the two ''state-affiliated'' research sectors, one operating within and the other outside the higher education system, the differences in their institutional structures were to have a sustained influence on the transformation process.

Being a ''bourgeois author'' he was subjected to the mechanisms of exclusion and marginalization typically applied to Western modernists. Nevertheless, marked differences can be traced over the 40-year existence of the GDR in how the state dealt with the man considered today to be the world's most influential German-language author in the field of sociology. By looking first at Georg Lukacs's criticism of German sociology in the light of the national socialist experience, then at the establishment of sociology in East Germany in the sixties and finally at the discussion on historical theory (the analysis of formations through history) in the seventies and eighties, this article describes the retreat from tradition and the gradual process of re-adaptation which occurred in the GDR not only in the case of Max Weber's works, but which was typical of East Germany's treatment of Western modernists. The reception of Weber's works in the GDR focused on the fundamental positions in his theories of value and cognition as well as his methodology. Even here acceptance was hindered by unsurpassable hurdles erected by a political regime whose survival depended on the legitimizing ideology of Marxism-Leninism.},

It starts from two findings of political science which - at a first glance - seem to be incompatible: On the one hand, unification politics took place in an exceptional. situation which, according to a widely held view, gave central government an extraordinary sovereignty in decisions. On the other hand, the decisions actually made did not reflect the interests of central government in changing the status quo, but led almost entirely to the unmodified transfer of West German institutions. This apparently paradoxical result can be explained by the pre-unification situation in West German policy sectors. Three sectoral dimensions explain the results of unification politics: consent vs. dissent among the actors in institutional issues; ''Politikverflechtung'' vs. the dominance of a single actor; and (eventually) an interest of the dominating actor in changing the status quo. Taking three policy sectors - health care, research and telecommunications - as examples, the paper demonstrates how different combinations of these three dimensions resulted in the transfer of West German institutions to East Germany.},

The centralized non-university sociological institutes as well as other institutes for the social sciences in the new federal states were dismantled without replacement. This loss, both in terms of personnel and scientific expertise, could not be compensated for, despite ambitious financial support and integration programs and the independent founding of private research institutes. A good third of the sociologists employed by non-university institutes in the GDR found themselves out of a job or went into retirement following German unification. Around 40\% are still performing scientific work, though only a small portion have permanent positions or opportunities for academic advancement. The mobility patterns of sociologists differ depending on institution. The major variables include the typical qualifications, research subjects and organization, location and political influence. Due to the winding up of these institutes without replacement and the general prevalence of West German scientists, further financial assistance, in particular for young scientists, is called for.

The Machiavellian strategy of take-over of East German statehood in the first phase seemed to be nessesary because of reasons of foreign policy. Later the constraints were home-made because the government wanted to secure the irreversibility of process wich cost so much Westgerman money. East Germany insisted on quick equalisation of wages wich contributed to the deindustrialisation of the country because the East Germans were not ready to serve for a while as a country of ''cheap wages'' such as neighbouring Czechia.

Furthermore, the information available has proved to be inclusive, with some studies indicating that men are more concerned about the environment than women, others indicating that women are more concerned but only in relation to a narrow range of risk-related environmental issues, and still others finding no significant differences. Using nationally representative survey data from the United States, Great Britain, Norway, the Netherlands, West Germany, East Germany, and Japan, this study investigates gender differences in levels of scientific knowledge and its consequences for attitudes toward general environmental issues. The results suggest that although men and women do differ in terms of their knowledge of scientific matters, this has little or no effect on their attitudes toward the environment. Across a majority of nations, women are not more concerned about environmental issues than men and this lack of relationship holds whether or not differences in levels of scientific knowledge are controlled for in the analysis.},

A comprehensive and convincing approach to GDR-history still hasn't emerged.

This alternative historical culture in the East is supported very largely by historians of the former GDR who lost their jobs following the evaluations and restructuring of the GDR's system of higher education in the wake of reunification. It finds expression in a multitude of historical associations, some of which are briefly mentioned. The historians, who have been active here, have been drawing up a balance sheet of their own for the historical sciences in the GDR. The article explores the way in which they engage with their own past as historians in the GDR and with the past of the state and the party with which they, for the most part, identified. Finally, the article analyses the diverse ways in which this alternative historical culture has assessed the revolution of 1989 and the subsequent reunification process. It concludes by asking about the prospects for this alternative historical culture in the medium to long term.},

In East Germany, people working in theater were strongly protected: homogeneous training, lifetime employment, the stability of forms of artistic cooperation, etc. Since reunification, a new division of labor and a new human resource management have been imposed in public theaters. The profession's rules are changing as the itineraries of theater people are being individualized. The diversification of the theater world makes public institutions fragile. On the basis of field work in Saxony, questions are raised about how public theaters are being recomposed in the East.

Fortunately enough the war conflict was avoided, but in August the same year the last open door from Eastern Europe to the West closed. The building of the inaccessible Berlin Wall did not solve the problems but accumulated new tension. This topic has not been treated so far in scientific literature. This article is the first attempt to elucidate two main groups of problems: firstly, the Bulgarian reaction towards the actual building of the Berlin Wall; and secondly how this dramatic event had its long-lasting effect on the Bulgarian national security services and border-line control. This article also reproduces the alarming atmosphere in Berlin through the eyes of the Bulgarian diplomats. Looking for a balance in the relations with the two German states Bulgaria stayed reserved and quite cautious during the whole crisis. Despite the severe border-line control and the Bulgarian national security services activation and cooperation with the German Ministerium fur Staatssicherheit Bulgaria's Eastern Bloc borders with Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey were quite a temptation to many East Germany tourists for making an escape to the other Germany.},

How do macrosocietal changes-such as the transition from state socialism in East Germany in 1989-correlate with changes in the social and organizational structures that maintain psychological categories? This essay focuses on how-pre-1989-the category of neurosis (as a mental disorder) became entwined with East Germany's grand socialist project of creating new socialist personalities, a new society, and a new science and on how diagnostic preferences were adapted, modified, and extended by local cultural and institutional practices. It also examines how post-1989 the category of neurosis became redefined in accord with a formerly West German psychotherapeutic paradigm and was eventually obliterated by the bureaucratic health care system of the new Germany. East German practitioners adopted new therapeutic guidelines and a new language to make sense of the "normal," "neurotic," and "pathological" self in terms of "individualizing forms of knowledge" 1 that tied in with efforts to remake East German citizens as liberal democratic subjects. At the same time, practitioners' clinical practice remained based upon face-to-face encounters in which formal guidelines and stipulations were often superseded by local, interactional, institutional, and cultural practices and contingencies.},

	abstract = {Research on media use in authoritarian political systems supports the thesis that media offerings in such systems suffer from a low factor of credibility, leading to declining political interest within society, continuous retreat into the private sphere and heavy use of foreign media offerings in the search of trustworthy information. The literature indicates that both the political and centrally controlled media system have an impact on the communication needs of citizens. These findings are at odds with audience research into democratic societies, which has emphasized entertainment as the most important variable for media use, whereas only a few segments of the audience are interested in genuinely political items. This article argues that the above assumptions concerning media use in countries governed by authoritarian regimes have failed to recognize the role of daily life in media selection and reception. It points out that communication science has ignored citizens' predominant desire for entertainment and over-estimated their need for information. The typology of East German media consumers presented in this article shows that, rather than being formed by the political system and a specific media landscape, people's communication needs are primarily shaped by the routines and patterns of everyday life.},

The incurable structural deficiencies of State Socialism do not offer a sufficient explanation for "1989". Only when faced with the new global historical constellation of circumstances which developed at the beginning of the 1970s with the electronic revolution and globalisation did the State Socialist countries prove to be definitely defeated in the competition of the economic systems. The death sentence was already pronounced over the State Socialist systems at the beginning of the 1970s, but the paths towards execution were long and different, as becomes clear with regard to the GDR, Czechoslovakia as well as Poland and Hungary.},

The paper argues that this development was the result of not only a political conflict, fought with repression and pure power, but also an ideological conflict. The institutional conflicts between churches and the state were intertwined with ideological conflicts, above all the devaluation of religion by scientistic arguments. Since the second half of the 19th century numerous organisations engaged in the promotion of science as an explicit counterpart to traditional religion. During the existence of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), this movement took off in the country's institutions. The article outlines this development by focussing on the Urania. Founded in 1888 to provide scientific knowledge without an anti-religious agenda, in 1954 the Urania was resurrected in the GDR to propagate the "Scientific World-View." The Urania tried to combine popular scientific themes (astronomy, aerospace) with a particular interpretation referring to the Wissenschaftliche Weltanschauung. The article analyses the program and work of the Urania until the end of the GDR. Finally it presents research results to show how this promotion of scientism contributed to the East German secularization process on an individual level.},

Our hypothesis is that the success of the secularization process in the GDR is closely interrelated with this conflictive framework. Our data indicate three levels of this conflict: about membership, world interpretation and ethics. These conflicts did not remain on the level of repression alone, but acquired subjective plausibility for much of the population. Consequently our approach is based on a general theory of conflict; it is historically grounded; and it takes its starting point from the perspectives of laypersons in the religious-ideological field.},

This much-invoked but poorly understood chapter in the history of Soviet science brought into relief a larger set of issues on the constitutive role of science and technology in the articulation of a Soviet national identity during the early cold war. These factors, which included a resurgence of postwar nationalism and the culture of extreme secrecy, forced an unlikely outcome to the question of how best to make use of German expertise: reframe the Germans as "less useful" and send them home. Here, the intersection of cold war imperatives, technology transfer, and national identity produced a condition in which the Germans' ultimate fate had less to do with their expertise (which was quite impressive) than the perception of their expertise. The latter was easier to manipulate and eventually overshadowed the former.},

Its starting point is the observation that an introduction of certain psychotropic drugs like tranquilizers was initially controversial in the GDR. As a consequence, the key question is how an agreement over their medical and economic benefit was reached eventually. The article shows how in the course of the 1960s a discursive arrangement between the medical profession, pharmaceutical industry and the state apparatus emerged, which was supported by an increased political involvement of leading scientists and the directing staff of enterprises.},

The subject treated was the attitude towards religion of famous physicist Max Planck who had died a few years earlier, in 1947. The article analyses the different positions of the contributors, mainly with a view to developing a categorial framework usable in descriptions and analyses of the religious attitudes of natural scientists. Moreover the different stages of the debate are outlined in order to exhibit their connections to the larger historical context, i.e. the unfolding of the cold war. In the light of this the debate can be regarded as a religious or ideological war, albeit a cold one, on German soil, which fortunately did not escalate into a hot conflict. It ended, as can be illustrated in a late contribution to the debate, with the collapse of the GDR in 1989 or shortly thereafter.},

We analyze different variations of non-religious positions in this context. In both constellations the non-religious position acquires a positive identity by reference to science.

	abstract = {Since the 19th Century, lignite mining and processing has left an indelible mark on the environment in East Germany, particularly around the cities of Halle and Leipzig. The European Commission in the 1990s, regarded the waste dumps and underground abandoned shafts as a major hazard and commissioned a multi-dimensional scientific team, under the title Eureka Project 674 (Advanced Mobile Analytical Laboratory or AMAL), to oversee a preliminary Environmental Impact Assessment (ETA) of the worst affected areas. Advanced mobile laboratories were built to access sites, recover complex matrices and make overall assessments of the scale of the problem, as leakage from century-old waste pits were causing hazardous environmental and health issues in the local areas. The mobile laboratories were equipped with an inductively-coupled mass spectrometer (ICP-MS), gas-chromatography mass spectrometer (GC-MS), x-ray fluorescence (XRF) instruments and specially designed coring equipment to recover soil-gas and liquids, and other complex samples from subsurface waste pits and water basins. One of the key outcomes of the on-site surveys was the delineation of hot-spots of contamination in mine dumps (Ascheberg) and tar-pools (Schumzelteich), which over time migrated through the natural shale pit-liner into drinking water (water wells). An interpretation of the leakage anomalies suggests that the clay layer was breached over time, due to overloading of the pits and/or structural damage to the pits, which eventually permeated the environmental hinterland and aquifers. The critical choice of pit-liners in any future waste pit containment for similar chemical materials is essential to long-term sequestration of industrial wastes.},

This study quantifies the burden of alcohol attributable mortality in the two parts of Germany in the 1990s, taking account of both adverse and beneficial effects of alcohol. We used an epidemiological approach that applies cause-specific alcohol attributable fractions derived from published relative risks and data on the distribution of alcohol consumption in east and west Germany in 1990/1992 and 1998 to mortality data for the two regions in 1992 and 1997, thus producing an estimate of the number of alcohol attributable deaths 'caused' or 'prevented'. Including the cardio-protective effect of alcohol, there were about 1.4\% more deaths among men aged 20 + in 1992 in Germany than would have been expected in a non-drinking population, while there were 0.1\% fewer deaths among women. By 1997, this had increased to 1.8\% excess male deaths and 0.1\% excess female deaths. In 1997, alcohol 'caused' 9.0\% of all deaths in east German men compared with 5.6\% in the west (women east: 2.5\%; women west: 2.2\%). At the same time, alcohol 'prevented' 5.2\% deaths in east German men compared with 4.3\% in the west, while there were 2.9\% and 2.0\% fewer deaths in women. This resulted in a net excess of deaths due to alcohol, except east German women, where 0.3\% deaths were estimated to have been averted by alcohol. Although by 1997 net deaths 'caused' by alcohol had increased in the west and declined in the east, the burden of mortality due to alcohol among men remained highest in the east whereas in women the order had reversed. Mortality attributable to alcohol contributes considerably to overall mortality and to the east-west gap in Germany. This study points to the need for comprehensive policies on alcohol in Germany to close the persisting east-west health gap. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, when the diagnosis is actual, in this sample population of women, an estimated minimum of 90\% opt to terminate their pregnancies. Data collected at two German hospitals-one in former East Germany, one in former West Germany-illuminate rates of PDT use and provide data with which to discuss the specter of post-diagnostic abortion in relation to mainstream medical discourses, Germany's divided history, abortion politics, feminism, disability activism, and religion.

Findings - Despite the centralist directives from the Ministry for University and Technical College Education regarding the classification of dissertations, actual classification of doctoral theses has been handled very differently by the various institutions. Originality/value - Dealing with this legacy, that is, returning the secret dissertations into the general stocks and listing them in the bibliographies and general catalogues, took several years.

	abstract = {In 1960 the German poet Franz Mon edited a book with the title "movens", which was to become a milestone in the aesthetic re-orientation of Central Europe following the catastrophic events of the 1930s/40s. The "documents and analyses of poetry, visual arts, music, architecture" were contrived as program, analysis and record of contemporary art. The key term "movement" was conceived not only as 'motion' or kinetics' but also, crucially, as the processual nature of art and information. These aesthetics qualify the experimental poetics program as it has developed since then. This essay concentrates on the programmatic aspect of this project and reflects on its network of categories and arguments. They are related to the example of a unique artist, whose impressive work appeared on an international scale for the first time in "movens": Carlfriedrich Claus (1930-1998) was a Tare artistic character who realised the "movens" poetics in the context of a totalitarian communist system (GDR). Above all, Claus pursued aesthetic experiments as a profound exploration of sign processes and self. The discussion of these phenomena is critically confronted with the concept of neo-avant-garde. Whether this concept can theoretically be more than a pejorative attribution is questioned. However, the aesthetics of movement as realisation of the experimental poetics program are analysed in respect to aspects of the avant-garde discourse such as the relation to the historical avant-garde movements, to the development of information technologies, to the self-referentiality of art and its overlap with science, and to the distinction between art and life.},

	abstract = {Through the administrative reform of 1952, which replaced the five federal states with fourteen districts, the GDR became by far the most centralized state in German history. There has been a remarkable scholarly consensus that following on from this reform state and party were successful in overcoming regional and local identifications. Historians and social scientists discerned a revival of regional identifications from the late 1970s, and explained this as a popular response to the re-evaluation of regional traditions by state and party. This article demonstrates, by contrast, that regional traditions were alive and well throughout the existence of the GDR. Whereas it is true that during the 1960s and the 1970s the state tried to popularize its districts, state and party were always constrained by other, conflicting concerns. Most importantly, the popular demand for leisure and entertainment could be met most easily (and most cheaply) with folklore. Moreover, accentuating regional diversity through local tradition became crucial in a small country in which travel opportunities abroad were extremely restricted. The evolution of local identifications in the GDR points to the limits of a dictatorship. The SED was severely constrained by the divergent interests of different cultural actors, and by the party's acceptance that it needed to respond to popular cultural desires. This article also shows how, over the 40 years of the GDR's existence, distinctive local identities developed and evolved without ever being closely linked to socialism or the state. This insight is indispensable for understanding how the GDR dissolved in 1990, and the persistence of regional specificities and identifications that long outlasted the GDR.},

From the middle of the 1970s onwards, the Western European welfare states also showed signs of structural weakness which were countered by reforms. At about the same time, Eastern European socialist command economies suffered from stagnation. The crisis of socialist social policy was synonymous with a crisis of the full employment principle and the corresponding general obligation to work. Last but not least it was the crisis of the extraordinarily far-reaching system of consumer price subsidies. The article investigates the genesis of these crisis and reform processes in a comparative perspective, using the Federal Republic Germany and France as case studies on the one hand, the German Democratic Republic and Poland on the other.},

After this strategy failed, there was only one way West Germany could still limit GDR visibility and underscore its own strength: by winning more medals than the socialist challenger. This attitude transformed sport into an arena for the competing political systems and yielded the same results in both German states: sport became politicized, the sports systems centralized and sports sciences more important.

Also, the effects of limited contracts do not differ across educational level, qualification level of the occupational position, or economic sector. In contrast to these results, periods of unemployment seem to increase the risk of postponement of reproduction both in East and in West Germany. However, these fertility patterns turn out to be rather different between East and West Germany: While in West Germany family formation is postponed especially when the male partner is unemployed, the process of family formation in East Germany is above all influenced by the employment situation of the woman and not so much by that of her partner.},

This study argues that employment decisions of mothers vary not only with the institutional settings but also with the dominant representative culture of a region. In order to study the effects of culture and institutions on maternal employment, Belgium, East, and West Germany are selected for empirical analysis. In a first step the article demonstrates that these regions differ considerably in terms of family political measures but also in terms of the cultural orientations with regard to female employment. While both Belgium and East Germany (but not West Germany) have well-developed public childcare systems for the under-3s, East Germans have a more favourable opinion towards female employment than Belgians. In a second step the study shows by means of panel analyses that these cultural differences strongly determine female employment behavior. Results indicate that both East and West German mothers have significantly higher employment probabilities in the long-run than Belgian mothers. The well-developed childcare infrastructure and the short parental leave lead only temporarily - right after childbirth - to higher employment rates among Belgian mothers. With increasing age of the child the significance of cultural dispositions result in higher overall employment probabilities among German mothers. These empirical findings support the theoretical approach of Pfau-Effinger in treating both institutional structures and culture as (equally) crucial factors in explaining cross-national differences in mothers' employment.},

Adopting an intersectional approach to studying gender and executive leadership, it is argued that it is possible neither to identify a single 'female chief executive style' nor to a priori identify a set of 'female' policy positions. Because gender norms differ within and across countries, we must determine 'what kind' of a female politician we are studying to determine how her particular gender might impact on her governance.

The lower population-dependency of municipal revenues and expansive political programs in West Germany and Poland resolve the often-assumed positive relationship between population decline and municipal decision-making. However in East Germany such a relationship seems to be the case. Nevertheless, it cannot be explained with reference to the population discourse.

In reconstructing these three reforms, institutional history can serve as a context in which questions about the political nature of economic knowledge can be answered that remain speculative in a conceptual context. I thus present a natural experiment in the political epistemology of economics: How do economists respond to, resist, and stabilize, changing political regimes? How do economists renegotiate the autonomy of economic knowledge given changing demands as of its social task? Among others, I show that contrary to Robert Merton's old, but still widely held thesis in political epistemology that the values of science are compatible only with democratic regimes the totalitarian and authoritarian regimes created better conditions for methodological pluralism in economics than democratic society.

This article uses bibliometric and webometric techniques to gather data on the characteristics of TED presenters and videos and analyze the relationship between these characteristics and the subsequent impact of the videos. The results show that the presenters were predominately male and non-academics. Male-authored videos were more popular and more liked when viewed on YouTube. Videos by academic presenters were more commented on than videos by others and were more liked on YouTube, although there was little difference in how frequently they were viewed. The majority of academic presenters were senior faculty, males, from United States-based institutions, were visible online, and were cited more frequently than average for their field. However, giving a TED presentation appeared to have no impact on the number of citations subsequently received by an academic, suggesting that although TED popularizes research, it may not promote the work of scientists within the academic community.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/sec{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {InThe Historic Turn in the Human Scienceseleven scholars widely known for their interdisciplinary work investigate one of the most striking developments in the intellectual world today: the return to history by a wide range of academic disciplines. From "new historicism" in literary theory, to "ethnohistory," to "historical sociology," these new approaches have resulted both in more works of historical analysis and in a more self-conscious attempt to locate the human sciences in their own histories. The essays inThe Historic Turn in the Human Sciences--eight of them published here for the first time--take stock of these changes from the perspectives of some of the disciplines most deeply involved: anthropology, sociology, political science, law, literary studies, and history itself. Many of the authors have played a crucial role in producing the historic turn in their own disciplines. The volume as a whole, therefore, goes significantly beyond a mere inventory of these changes to ask how and how much history can make a difference; how the practice of history is affected by post-structural and other theories; and what is left of both unproblematized history and social science after the historic turn. Taken together the essays give a sense both of what these various turns to history have in common and what sets them apart. This comparative dimension distinguishes the volume from those that have analyzed the impact of history on a single field or have assayed its effects without including historians themselves. In the wake of the historic turn neither the historical actor nor the historical analyst will ever again be seen as a colossus striding over the pages of history. This volume explains in an extraordinary thought-provoking and challenging way why this must be so. Terrence J. McDonald is Professor of History, University of Michigan.},

	abstract = {This groundbreaking book represents the most systematic examination to date of the often-invoked but rarely examined declaration that "history matters." Most contemporary social scientists unconsciously take a "snapshot" view of the social world. Yet the meaning of social events or processes is frequently distorted when they are ripped from their temporal context. Paul Pierson argues that placing politics in time-constructing "moving pictures" rather than snapshots-can vastly enrich our understanding of complex social dynamics, and greatly improve the theories and methods that we use to explain them.Politics in Timeopens a new window on the temporal aspects of the social world. It explores a range of important features and implications of evolving social processes: the variety of processes that unfold over significant periods of time, the circumstances under which such different processes are likely to occur, and above all, the significance of these temporal dimensions of social life for our understanding of important political and social outcomes. Ranging widely across the social sciences, Pierson's analysis reveals the high price social science pays when it becomes ahistorical. And it provides a wealth of ideas for restoring our sense of historical process. By placing politics back in time, Pierson's book is destined to have a resounding and enduring impact on the work of scholars and students in fields from political science, history, and sociology to economics and policy analysis.},

Additionally, for almost 500,000 of these publications we correlated occurrence with impact, using the field-normalised citation metric CPP/FCSm. We compared occurrence and correlation with impact both at in general and for specific disciplines and took into account the variation within sets by (non-parametrically) bootstrapping the calculation of impact values. We also compared use and impact of individual characters in the 30 fields in which non-alphanumeric characters occur most frequently, by using heatmaps that clustered and reordered fields and characters. We conclude that the use of some non-alphanumeric characters, such as the hyphen and colon, is common in most titles and that not including such characters generally correlates negatively with impact. Specific disciplines on the other hand, may show either a negative, absent, or positive correlation. We also found that thematically related science fields use non-alphanumeric characters in comparable numbers, but that impact associated with such characters shows a less strong thematic relation. Overall, it appears that authors cannot influence success of publications by including non-alphanumeric characters in fields where this is not already commonplace. © 2011.},

The most common measure of title “informativeness” has been the number of “substantive” words included in it, and one of the factors which might be associated with it is the number of authors. The present study attempted to test, in a large group of journals fromdifferent areas, and over six decades, the hypothesis that a paper signed by a larger number of authors will have more substantive words in its title. Large samples of original research papers were drawn from each decade year of fourteen leading journals. For each paper, the number of substantive words in the title was correlated with the number of authors. Findings indicate a difference between the scientific journals on the one hand, and the social sciences and humanities journals on the other. A moderate positive correlation was found in most scientific journals (excluding mathematics) for many periods. In the social sciences journals, and to a greater extent, in the humanities journals, a significant positive correlation was limited to only a few periods, while the rest showed a very low correlation, or even a negative correlation. The different findings for the sciences may be somehow associated with their higher rate of multiple authorship.},

The procedure focuses on use of specific terms in the citing sentences and the joint appearance of cited references. After a manual screening process to remove non-discoveries, a list of over 100 discoveries and their associated articles is compiled and characterized by subject matter and by type of discovery. The phenomenon of multiple discovery is shown to play an important role. The onset and timing of recognition of the articles are studied by comparing the number of citing sentences with and without discovery terms, and show both early onset and delays in recognition. A comparative analysis of the vocabularies of the discovery and non-discovery sentences reveals the types of words and concepts that scientists associate with discoveries. A machine learning application is used to efficiently extend the list. Implications of the findings for understanding the nature and justification of scientific discoveries are discussed.},

Citation indicates the connection between two papers. Also, the text associated with citation can reflect the contribution of scientific papers, expressions of authors' opinions or other researches and also can show the usage of the research to resolve problems.

This paper-part of a larger study which will examine how various kinds of significance can be related to one another in a coherent theoretical framework-focusses on the processes by which new knowledge claims are being integrated into the cognitive structure when they are cited in other papers. Citations appear both as "threads" linking the citing papers to the existing literature in the field, and as elements fulfilling specific functions within the arguments made in these papers. We have found that (1) it is misleading to equate every article with a single knowledge claim, let alone with an attempt to construct "a fact"; (2) even when the same "sentence" is cited repeatedly, it can be put to quite different uses in the citing papers; and (3) the process of codification of scientific knowledge through the use of references appears to be far more complex and multi-dimensional than citation context analyses focussing on the use and the gradual disappearance of modalities would lead us to believe. Some consequences for the use use of citation analysis to reconstruct cognitive structures will be discussed. © 1989 Akadémiai Kiadó.},

	volume = {13},
	doi = {10.1007/s10791-009-9108-x},
	abstract = {Document clustering has many important applications in the area of data mining and information retrieval. Many existing document clustering techniques use the bag-of-words model to represent the content of a document. However, this representation is only effective for grouping related documents when these documents share a large proportion of lexically equivalent terms. In other words, instances of synonymy between related documents are ignored, which can reduce the effectiveness of applications using a standard full-text document representation. To address this problem, we present a new approach for clustering scientific documents, based on the utilization of citation contexts. A citation context is essentially the text surrounding the reference markers used to refer to other scientific works. We hypothesize that citation contexts will provide relevant synonymous and related vocabulary which will help increase the effectiveness of the bag-of-words representation. In this paper, we investigate the power of these citation-specific word features, and compare them with the original document's textual representation in a document clustering task on two collections of labeled scientific journal papers from two distinct domains: High Energy Physics and Genomics. We also compare these text-based clustering techniques with a link-based clustering algorithm which determines the similarity between documents based on the number of co-citations, that is in-links represented by citing documents and out-links represented by cited documents. Our experimental results indicate that the use of citation contexts, when combined with the vocabulary in the full-text of the document, is a promising alternative means of capturing critical topics covered by journal articles. More specifically, this document representation strategy when used by the clustering algorithm investigated in this paper, outperforms both the full-text clustering approach and the link-based clustering technique on both scientific journal datasets. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Altmetrics, indices based on social media platforms and tools, have recently emerged as alternative means of measuring scholarly impact. Such indices assume that scholars in fact populate online social environments, and interact with scholarly products there. We tested this assumption by examining the use and coverage of social media environments amongst a sample of bibliometricians. As expected, coverage varied: 82\% of articles published by sampled bibliometricians were included in Mendeley libraries, while only 28\% were included in CiteULike. Mendeley bookmarking was moderately correlated (.45) with Scopus citation. Over half of respondents asserted that social media tools were affecting their professional lives, although uptake of online tools varied widely. 68\% of those surveyed had LinkedIn accounts, while Academia.edu, Mendeley, and ResearchGate each claimed a fifth of respondents. Nearly half of those responding had Twitter accounts, which they used both personally and professionally. Surveyed bibliometricians had mixed opinions on altmetrics' potential; 72\% valued download counts, while a third saw potential in tracking articles' influence in blogs, Wikipedia, reference managers, and social media. Altogether, these findings suggest that some online tools are seeing substantial use by bibliometricians, and that they present a potentially valuable source of impact data.},

This paper is intended to find out if the number of citations made to an article was associated with title length and number of punctuation marks in titles. The article also attempts to determine the most/least frequently used punctuation marks in article titles, and to study titling features in top-30 articles in the dataset examined. To extract the data, ISI Web of Science was searched using the fields, source 'SO = Scientometrics' and publishing year 'PY = 2009-2011'. In all, 650 article titles constituted the sample data of the study. To determine title length in words and in characters (with no spaces), the 'word count' option -- 'statistics' -- in Microsoft Word was used. The types and number of punctuation marks were extracted using the 'find and replace' option in Microsoft Word. Data analysis revealed that the two variables title length and citations to articles were not correlated; the number of punctuation marks could not be used as a variable to predict an article's citation rate with certainty; 'colon', 'hyphen' and 'coma' were most frequent while 'semi-colon', 'dash' and 'single quotation marks' were least frequent punctuation marks; out of the 30 top titles, 23 included at least one punctuation mark; from the top-10 titles, 9 titles encompassed a punctuation mark and the article receiving the highest amount of citations along with 5 more articles had a question mark in their titles. The average title length in characters with no spaces was 73 in the top-30 titles.},

First, the most commonly studied types of bibliometric networks (i.e., citation, co-citation, bibliographic coupling, keyword co-occurrence, and coauthorship networks) are discussed, and three popular visualization approaches (i.e., distance-based, graph-based, and timeline-based approaches) are distinguished. Next, an overview is given of a number of software tools that can be used for visualizing bibliometric networks. In the second part of the chapter, the focus is specifically on two software tools: VOSviewer and CitNetExplorer. The techniques used by these tools to construct, analyze, and visualize bibliometric networks are discussed. In addition, tutorials are offered that demonstrate in a step-by-step manner how both tools can be used. Finally, the chapter concludes with a discussion of the limitations and the proper use of bibliometric network visualizations and with a summary of some ongoing and future developments.},

Although different criteria are used by scientometrists in order to measure internationality and to supplement its minimal literal meaning, the present study suggests that no single criterion alone is sufficient. This paper surveys, critically-assesses and extends the existing measures of internationality in the context of academic publishing and identifies those criteria that are most clearly resolved and amenable to quantitative analysis. When applied, however, to a case study of four thematically-connected journals from the field of Health and Clinical Psychology using descriptive statistics and the Gini Coefficient, the measurement of internationality using these criteria was found to be ambiguous. We conclude that internationality is best viewed as a mathematically fuzzy entity and that a single measure Internationality Index, constructed from a combination of suitably weighted criteria, is the only way to unambiguously quantify the degree of internationality.},

Do abstracts tend to use conceptually broader terms than sentences in a citation context in the body of a publication? In this article, we propose a method to analyze and compare latent topics in scientific publications, in particular, from abstracts of papers that cited a target reference and from sentences that cited the target reference. We conducted an experiment and applied topical modeling techniques to full-text papers in eight biomedicine journals. Topics derived from the two sources are compared in terms of their similarities and broad-narrow relationships defined based on information entropy. The results show that abstracts and citation contexts are characterized by distinct sets of topics with moderate overlaps. Furthermore, the results confirm that topics from abstracts of citing papers have broader terms than topics from citation contexts formed by citing sentences. The method and the findings could be used to enhance and extend the current methodologies for research evaluation and citation evaluation. © 2013 ASIS\&T.},

Findings: Readers are able to perceive correctly author reasons for citation only to a very limited extent. Research limitations/implications: Limitations are a small sample of ten articles and 45 reader assessments of those articles, and the use of a single classification of reasons for citation. Practical implications: The findings call into question techniques such as citation context analysis that are based on the assumption that readers understand the reasons why authors cite material. Originality/value: This is the first attempt to compare author and reader reasons for citation and hence to validate the use of citation context analysis. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Since machine-readable documents have become widespread, some recent studies have proposed retrieval methods using a combination of citation linkage and its context. In the case of co-citation linkage, there have been attempts to discern 'strong' co-citations from 'weak' ones by examining the positions of citations in a document. However, this promising concept has not yet been sufficiently evaluated, and it remains unclear whether search performance is significantly improved. Therefore, this paper explores the effects of using co-citation context more deeply and more widely by comparing the search performance of six retrieval methods, which differ as to whether co-citation context and normalization using cited frequency are used. For empirically evaluating the effects, a special test collection was created from CiteSeer Metadata, and the search performances of the six retrieval methods were compared by two IR metrics (AP and nDCG). The main conclusions of this paper are: (1) co-citation context has a positive effect on co-citation searching; (2) the normalization technique using cited frequency is useful for context-based co-citation searching; (3) approaches of using co-citation context tend to affect the characteristics of search performance. © 2012 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

In this paper, we design a retrieval system based on full texts in the PubMed Central database. We constructed two modules in the retrieval system. One is a reference retrieval module based on citation contexts. Another is a citation context retrieval module for searching the citation contexts of a specific paper. The results of comparisons show that the reference retrieval module performed better than Google Scholar and PubMed database in terms of finding proper references based on topic words extracted from citation context. It also performed very well on searching highly cited papers and classic papers.

In particular, we describe our dataset for citation polarity and citation purpose, present experimental results on the automatic detection of these indicators, and demonstrate the use of such annotations for studying research dynamics and scientific summarization. We also look at two complementary problems that show up in Natural-Language-Processing-driven citation analysis for a specific target paper. The first problem is extracting citation context, the implicit citation sentences that do not contain explicit anchors to the target paper. The second problem is extracting reference scope, the target relevant segment of a complicated citing sentence that cites multiple papers.

	abstract = {© 2016 IEEE.Effectively exploring and browsing document collections is a fundamental problem in visualization. Traditionally, document visualization is based on a data model that represents each document as the set of its comprised words, effectively characterizing what the document is. In this paper we take an alternative perspective: motivated by the manner in which users search documents in the research process, we aim to visualize documents via their usage, or how documents tend to be used. We present a new visualization scheme - cite2vec - that allows the user to dynamically explore and browse documents via how other documents use them, information that we capture through citation contexts in a document collection. Starting from a usage-oriented word-document 2D projection, the user can dynamically steer document projections by prescribing semantic concepts, both in the form of phrase/document compositions and document:phrase analogies, enabling the exploration and comparison of documents by their use. The user interactions are enabled by a joint representation of words and documents in a common high-dimensional embedding space where user-specified concepts correspond to linear operations of word and document vectors. Our case studies, centered around a large document corpus of computer vision research papers, highlight the potential for usage-based document visualization.},

As a consequence, the distributions of the indicators are not comparable across different disciplines. Here we show that the most popular journal citation indicators used in quality assessment - the journal impact factors of Thomson Scientific and the scientific journal rankings of Scopus - are strongly correlated with the proportion of within-database references, and even more so with the number of within-database recent references per paper. No significant correlations were found with other bibliometric magnitudes. We anticipate that these results will be a starting point for more sophisticated indicator models that take this dependence into account, and for the design of strategies aimed at extending such bibliometric databases as Thomson Scientific's Science Citation Index or Elsevier's Scopus to improve their capacity to evaluate all sciences.},

	abstract = {The goal of this study was to determine the research impact of scientific fraud through citation analysis of 20 Breuning publications, using the 1980 to 1988 Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index. These publications received 200 citations, of which 80 (40.0\%) were self-citations by Breuning or his coauthors. Tracked over time, non—self-citations declined sharply in 1986 and later years, coinciding with disclosure of Breuning's fraud. The data indicated that, in this case, researchers effectively shunned work known to be or even suspected of being falsified. Unique citation contexts (101) were examined to see how citing authors used Breuning's work: 33 were negative (disagreed with findings/methods), 10 positive (agreed), and 58 neutral (no valuation). Also, 63 were inconsequential (no influence on the citing author's analysis/conclusion). Thirty-eight were material, but 21 of these led to negative conclusions. These data diminish the apparent impact of Breuning's work suggested by total citations alone.(JAMA. 1990;263:1424-1426)},

Concentration measures also vary between disciplines; social sciences and humanities generally being the most concentrated. The article also shows that the correspondence between the elites defined by each of these measures is limited. In fact, only 3.2\% of the researchers are in the top 10\% for all indicators, while about 20\% are in the top 10\% for at least one of the indicators.

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present a narrative review of studies on the citing behavior of scientists, covering mainly research published in the last 15 years. Based on the results of these studies, the paper seeks to answer the question of the extent to which scientists are motivated to cite a publication not only to acknowledge intellectual and cognitive influences of scientific peers, but also for other, possibly non-scientific, The review covers research published from the early 1960s up to mid-2005 (approximately 30 studies on citing behavior-reporting results in about 40 publications). Findings The general tendency of the results of the empirical studies makes it clear that citing behavior is not motivated solely by the wish to acknowledge intellectual and cognitive influences of colleague scientists, since the individual studies reveal also other, in part non-scientific, factors that play a part in the decision to cite. However, the results of the studies must also be deemed scarcely reliable: the studies vary widely in design, and their results can hardly be replicated. Many of the studies have methodological weaknesses. Furthermore, there is evidence that the different motivations of citers are not so different or randomly given to such an extent that the phenomenon of citation would lose its role as a reliable measure of impact. Originality/value Given the increasing importance of evaluative bibliometrics in the world of scholarship, the question What do citation counts measure? is a particularly relevant and topical issue.},

Methods: Use data supplied by three major vendors of electronic journals were compared to reshelving data for corresponding print titles, impact factors, and presence on Brandon/Hill Lists. Results: In collections where one-click access from a database record to the full text of articles was possible, electronic use correlated with print use across journal pairs. In both versions, Brandon/Hill titles were used more frequently than non-Brandon/Hill titles, use had modest correlations with journals' impact factors, and clinical use appeared to be higher than research use. Titles that had not been selected for the library's print collections, but which were bundled into publishers' packages, received little use compared to electronic titles also selected in print. Conclusions: Collection development practices based on quality and user needs can be applied with confidence to the electronic environment. Facilitating direct connections between citation databases and the corresponding journal articles regardless of platform or publisher will support scholarship and quality health care.},

This review is limited to the events and issues within the broad topics Of cost, management, and archiving. Coverage of cost includes such initiatives as PEAK, JACC, BioMed Central, SPARC, open access, the "Big Deal," and "going e-only. " Librarians combated the continued price increase trend for journals, fueled in part by publisher mergers, with the economies found with bundled packages and consortial subscriptions. Serials management topics include usage statistics; core title lists; staffing needs; the "A-Z list" and other services from such companies as Serials Solutions; "deep linking"; link resolvers such as SFX; development of standards or guidelines, such as COUNTER and ERMI, tracking of license terms; vendor mergers; and the demise of integrated library systems and a subscription agent's bankruptcy. Librarians archived print volumes in storage facilities due to space shortages. Librarians and publishers struggled with electronic archiving concepts, discussing questions of who, where, and how. Projects such as LOCKSS tested potential solutions, but missing online content due to the Tasini court case and retractions posed more archiving difficulties. The serials literature captured much of the upheaval resulting from the rapid pace of changes, many linked to the advent of e-journals.},

	abstract = {The collection and management of digital resources dominated collection development and management literature produced during 2004-8. Themes covered the changing nature of local collections, redefining collection management responsibilities and practices, cooperation and collaboration, and collection assessment and evaluation. The literature reflected the struggle to manage a vast array of resources while library budgets stagnated. While publishers continued to offer more bundles of electronic publications, librarians responded with strategies to collaborate and negotiate for feasible pricing structures. A culture of continuous assessment was a major topic. During this review period, access to and ownership of digital resources reemerged as a pervasive theme. The mood of the literature was generally optimistic in light of the considerable challenges libraries faced in managing their resources to accommodate the rapidly growing and ever-shifting digital landscape. While looking back on the established philosophy of traditional collections activities, authors moved decisively into the digital age and emerged with a positive vision of the future of library collections.

	abstract = {The increasingly large number of available writings describing technical and scientific progress, calls for advanced analytic tools for their efficient analysis. This is true for many application scenarios in science and industry and for different types of writings, comprising patents and scientific articles. Despite important differences between patents and scientific articles, both have a variety of common characteristics that lead to similar search and analysis tasks. However, the analysis and visualization of these documents is not a trivial task due to the complexity of the documents as well as the large number of possible relations between their multivariate attributes. In this survey, we review interactive analysis and visualization approaches of patents and scientific articles, ranging from exploration tools to sophisticated mining methods. In a bottom-up approach, we categorize them according to two aspects: (a) data type (text, citations, authors, metadata, and combinations thereof), and (b) task (finding and comparing single entities, seeking elementary relations, finding complex patterns, and in particular temporal patterns, and investigating connections between multiple behaviours). Finally, we identify challenges and research directions in this area that ask for future investigations.},

	abstract = {Looking at Open Science and Open Data from a broad perspective. This is the idea behind "Scientific data sharing: an interdisciplinary workshop", an initiative designed to foster dialogue between scholars from different scientific domains which was organized by the Istituto Italiano di Antropologia in Anagni, Italy, 2-4 September 2013.We here report summaries of the presentations and discussions at the meeting. They deal with four sets of issues: (i) setting a common framework, a general discussion of open data principles, values and opportunities; (ii) insights into scientific practices, a view of the way in which the open data movement is developing in a variety of scientific domains (biology, psychology, epidemiology and archaeology); (iii) a case study of human genomics, which was a trail-blazer in data sharing, and which encapsulates the tension that can occur between large-scale data sharing and one of the boundaries of openness, the protection of individual data; (iv) open science and the public, based on a round table discussion about the public communication of science and the societal implications of open science. There were three proposals for the planning of further interdisciplinary initiatives on open science. Firstly, there is a need to integrate top-down initiatives by governments, institutions and journals with bottom-up approaches from the scientific community. Secondly, more should be done to popularize the societal benefits of open science, not only in providing the evidence needed by citizens to draw their own conclusions on scientific issues that are of concern to them, but also explaining the direct benefits of data sharing in areas such as the control of infectious disease. Finally, introducing arguments from social sciences and humanities in the educational dissemination of open data may help students become more profoundly engaged with Open Science and look at science from a broader perspective.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT The free and open sharing of information, data, and materials regarding published research is vital to the replication of published results, the efficient advancement of science, and the education of students. Yet in daily practice, the ideal of free sharing is often breached. OBJECTIVE To understand the nature, extent, and consequences of data withholding in academic genetics. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Mailed survey (March-July 2000) of geneticists and other life scientists in the 100 US universities that received the most funding from the National Institutes of Health in 1998. Of a potential 3000 respondents, 2893 were eligible and 1849 responded, yielding an overall response rate of 64\%. We analyzed a subsample of 1240 self-identified geneticists and made a limited number of comparisons with 600 self-identified nongeneticists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Percentage of faculty who made requests for data that were denied; percentage of respondents who denied requests; influences on and consequences of withholding data; and changes over time in perceived willingness to share data. RESULTS Forty-seven percent of geneticists who asked other faculty for additional information, data, or materials regarding published research reported that at least 1 of their requests had been denied in the preceding 3 years. Ten percent of all postpublication requests for additional information were denied. Because they were denied access to data, 28\% of geneticists reported that they had been unable to confirm published research. Twelve percent said that in the previous 3 years, they had denied another academician's request for data concerning published results. Among geneticists who said they had intentionally withheld data regarding their published work, 80\% reported that it required too much effort to produce the materials or information; 64\%, that they were protecting the ability of a graduate student, postdoctoral fellow, or junior faculty member to publish; and 53\%, that they were protecting their own ability to publish. Thirty-five percent of geneticists said that sharing had decreased during the last decade; 14\%, that sharing had increased. Geneticists were as likely as other life scientists to deny others' requests (odds ratio [OR], 1.39; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-2.40) and to have their own requests denied (OR, 0.97; 95\% CI, 0.69-1.40). However, other life scientists were less likely to report that withholding had a negative impact on their own research as well as their field of research. CONCLUSIONS Data withholding occurs in academic genetics and it affects essential scientific activities such as the ability to confirm published results. Lack of resources and issues of scientific priority may play an important role in scientists' decisions to withhold data, materials, and information from other academic geneticists.},

IR is centrally concerned with the study of issues such as armed conflict, but wars are events – a series of occurrences that only come into being through their relationship across time. The concept of time at work in the understanding of this event thus plays an inextricable role in the scholarship produced. IR shares an understanding of time that pervades (traditional) social science and is based on the Western notion of clock-time. This conception of time encourages a spatiotemporal model of the past that epistemologically privileges temporal understandings that value generalizable, time-invariant theory and discount temporal fluidity and context. These temporal commitments operate at a deep level, informing and shaping theory construction in important ways and de-emphasizing alternative approaches that may more accurately reflect the contingency of international events, discontinuities in political practice, and the radical shifts in international structures, which are often most in need of scholarly analysis. This article concludes that by treating temporality as a stand-alone issue, IR can better model and predict international political practices.},

communication gap between researchers and policy makers will need to be narrowed to promote policies informed by evidence. Social media
represent an expanding channel for communication. Academic journals, public health agencies, and health care organizations are increasingly using social media to communicate health information. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now regularly tweets to 290,000 followers. We conducted a survey of health policy researchers about using social media and two traditional channels (traditional media and direct outreach) to disseminate research findings to policy makers. Researchers rated the efficacy of the three dissemination methods similarly but rated social media lower than the other two in three domains: researchers’ confidence in their ability to use the method, peers’ respect for its use, and how it is perceived in academic promotion.
Just 14 percent of our participants reported tweeting, and 21 percent
reported blogging about their research or related health policy in the
past year. Researchers described social media as being incompatible with research, of high risk professionally, of uncertain efficacy, and an
unfamiliar technology that they did not know how to use. Researchers
will need evidence-based strategies, training, and institutional resources to use social media to communicate evidence.},

This paper considers ways in which universities can reduce the widening generation gap that technology is creating between academics and their students. Students to access and share learning materials increasingly use social media and academics are forced to consider the pedagogical value of these platforms.
Many have been left feeling isolated and in many cases intimidated by the pervasive nature of social media in their professional life.
Where academics do adopt new forms of technology to enhance students’ learning experience, this is done with little or no support from the institution and in fact, many regard the bureaucracy of central university services and the inflexibility of IT services as impeding their efforts.
This paper reports the outcome of the first step in a study that focuses on developing a more systematic approach to academic‘s engagement with Social Media.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: The use of social media by dermatology journals and professional and patient-centered dermatology organizations remains largely unknown and, to our knowledge, has yet to be fully evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and quantify the extent of involvement of dermatology journals, professional dermatology organizations, and dermatology-related patient advocate groups on social networking sites. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We obtained an archived list of 102 current dermatology journals from SCImago on the World Wide Web and used the list to investigate Facebook, Twitter, and individual journal websites for the presence of social media accounts. We identified professional and patient-centered dermatology organization activity on social networks through queries of predetermined search terms on Google, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. The activity of each entity was documented by recording the following metrics of popularity: the numbers of Facebook "likes," Twitter "followers," and LinkedIn "members." MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The numbers of Facebook likes, Twitter followers, and LinkedIn members corresponding to each dermatology journal and each professional and patient-related dermatology organization. RESULTS: On July 17, 2012, of the 102 dermatology journals ranked by SCImago, 12.7\% were present on Facebook and 13.7\% on Twitter. We identified popular dermatology journals based on Facebook likes and Twitter followers, led by the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology and Dermatology Times, respectively. Popular professional dermatology organizations included dermRounds Dermatology Network (11 251 likes on Facebook and 2900 followers on Twitter). The most popular dermatology patient-centered organizations were the Skin Cancer Foundation (20 119 likes on Facebook), DermaTalk (21 542 followers on Twitter), and the National Psoriasis Foundation (200 members on LinkedIn). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Patient-centered and professional dermatology organizations use social networking sites; however, academic journals tend to lag behind significantly. Although some journals are active in social media, most have yet to recognize the potential benefits of fully embracing popular social networks.},

	abstract = {Academic publishing, as a practice and as a business, is undergoing the
most significant changes in its 350-year history. Electronic journals and books,
both Open Access and behind digital pay walls, are increasingly replacing printed
publications. In addition to formal channels of scholarly communication, a wide
array of semi-formal and informal channels such as email, mailing lists, blogs,
microblogs, and social networking sites (SNS) are widely used by scientists to
discuss their research (Borgman 2007, p. 47; Nentwich and König 2012, p. 50).
Scholarly blogs and services such as Twitter and Facebook are increasingly
attracting attention as new channels of science communication (see Bonetta 2007;
Kjellberg 2010; Herwig et al. 2009). Radically different conceptualizations of
scholarly (micro)blogging exist, with some users regarding them as a forum to
educate the public, while others see them as a possible replacement for traditional
publishing. This chapter will provide examples of blogs and microblogs as tools
for scientific communication for different stakeholders, as well as discuss their
implications for digital scholarship.},

	abstract = {In growing numbers, scholars are integrating social media tools like blogs, Twitter, and Mendeley into their professional communications. The online, public nature of these tools exposes and reifies scholarly processes once hidden and ephemeral. Metrics based on this activities could inform broader, faster measures of impact, complementing traditional citation metrics. This study explores the properties of these social media-based metrics or "altmetrics", sampling 24,331 articles published by the Public Library of Science. We find that that different indicators vary greatly in activity. Around 5\% of sampled articles are cited in Wikipedia, while close to 80\% have been included in at least one Mendeley library. There is, however, an encouraging diversity; a quarter of articles have nonzero data from five or more different sources. Correlation and factor analysis suggest citation and altmetrics indicators track related but distinct impacts, with neither able to describe the complete picture of scholarly use alone. There are moderate correlations between Mendeley and Web of Science citation, but many altmetric indicators seem to measure impact mostly orthogonal to citation. Articles cluster in ways that suggest five different impact "flavors", capturing impacts of different types on different audiences; for instance, some articles may be heavily read and saved by scholars but seldom cited. Together, these findings encourage more research into altmetrics as complements to traditional citation measures.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bibliometrics are an essential aspect of measuring academic and organizational performance. Aim. This review seeks to describe methods for measuring bibliometrics, identify the strengths and limitations of methodologies, outline strategies for interpretation, summarise evaluation of nursing and midwifery performance, identify implications for metric of evaluation, and specify the implications for nursing and midwifery and implications of social networking for bibliometrics and measures of individual performance.

METHOD: A review of electronic databases CINAHL, Medline, and Scopus was undertaken using search terms such as bibliometrics, nursing, and midwifery. The reference lists of retrieved articles and Internet sources and social media platforms were also examined.

RESULTS: A number of well-established, formal ways of assessment have been identified, including h- and c-indices. Changes in publication practices and the use of the Internet have challenged traditional metrics of influence. Moreover, measuring impact beyond citation metrics is an increasing focus, with social media representing newer ways of establishing performance and impact.

CONCLUSIONS: Even though a number of measures exist, no single bibliometric measure is perfect. Therefore, multiple approaches to evaluation are recommended. However, bibliometric approaches should not be the only measures upon which academic and scholarly performance are evaluated.},

the potential in social networking sites for recruiting participants and gathering data and
looks at the impact sites such as Facebook have had on building and maintaining trust

ability to uphold the “do no harm” principle guiding all academic research by jeopardizing

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to empirically examine cases in which Social Networking Sites (SNS) are being
utilized for scholarly purposes by higher-education institutes in Israel. The research addresses questions regarding
content patterns, activity patterns, and interactivity within Facebook and Twitter accounts of these
institutes. Research population comprises of 47 Facebook accounts and 26 Twitter accounts of Israeli universities
or colleges and/or sub-divisions within these institutes. In addition to descriptive statistics, all tweets
within Twitter accounts were analyzed and classified into categories, based on their content, for better understanding
of how they can facilitate informal learning. Research findings suggest that SNS promotes knowledge
sharing, thereby facilitating informal learning within the community; SNS open academic institutes to
the community altogether. Still, SNS were utilized in an assimilation mode, i.e. while the potential is high
for using special features enabled by SNS as well as unique sharing of information modes, de facto use of
these special features was extremely low. However, contrary to the relatively high dropout rates of SNS' personal
accounts, many academic accounts were frequently active for long periods of time. This may indicate
that SNS activity which is based on sharing of knowledge as well as on social interaction has better sustainability
prospects. Usage and content patterns of these accounts corresponded to parallel patterns in the Israeli
higher-education community in “real” life, hence reinforcing the role of these institutes within the community.
Overall, this study implies that the potential of SNS as means of sharing academic knowledge in higher
education institutes in Israel has not been actualized yet, but is indeed being explored by these organizations
as well as by the community.},

Using Wikipedia as a proxy for other social media, we explore the correlation between inclusion of a journal article in Wikipedia, and article impact as measured by citation count. We start by cataloging features of PubMed articles cited in Wikipedia. We find that Wikipedia pages referencing the most journal articles are about disorders and diseases, while the most referenced articles in Wikipedia are about genomics. We note that journal articles in Wikipedia have significantly higher citation counts than an equivalent random article subset. We also observe that articles are included in Wikipedia soon after publication.

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine how often university academic staff members use
and create various forms of social media for their work and how that use influences their use of
traditional scholarly information sources.
Design/methodology/approach – This article is based on a 2011 academic reading study conducted
at six higher learning institutions in the United Kingdom. Approximately 2,000 respondents completed
the web-based survey. The study used the critical incident of last reading by academics to gather
information on the purpose, outcomes, and values of scholarly readings and access to library collections.
In addition, academics were asked about their use and creation of social media as part of their work
activities. The authors looked at six categories of social media – blogs, videos/YouTube, RSS feeds,
Twitter feeds, user comments in articles, podcasts, and other. This article focuses on the influence of social
media on scholarly reading patterns.
Findings – Most UK academics use one or more forms of social media for work-related purposes, but
creation is less common. Frequency of use and creation is not as high as might be expected, with
academics using or creating social media occasionally rather than regularly. There are some differences in
use or creation based on demographic factors, including discipline and age. The use and creation of social
media does not adversely affect the use of traditional scholarly material, and high frequency users or
creators of social media read more scholarly material than others.
Originality/value – This paper illustrates that academics who are engaged with traditional
materials for their scholarly work are also embracing various forms of social media to a higher degree
than their colleagues. This suggests that social media tools could be a good addition to traditional
forms of scholarly content as a way to promote academic growth. Social media is not replacing
traditional scholarly material, but rather is enhancing their use.

To achieve this aim, we conducted semi-structured Critical Incident interviews with 15 postgraduate students from various disciplines. We found that the students did indeed come across academic social media content serendipitously – often when undertaking unfocused browsing during a break from other academic work. Time investment was identified as an important over-arching theme: investing time in creating and sharing social media content led to the creation of opportunities for serendipity for both the person creating/sharing the content and others. The interviews also highlighted a time investment trade-off – where more time spent using social media was perceived to provide greater opportunity for serendipity but, as serendipity can never be guaranteed, it was also perceived to increase the chance that none of the information encountered would contribute to the interviewees' academic research (and therefore would be ‘wasted’ time). We make a number of suggestions for the design of social media tools that create opportunities for serendipity based on our findings.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Twitter is one of the fastest growing social media networks for communication between users via short messages. Technology proficient physicians have demonstrated enthusiasm in adopting social media for their work.

OBJECTIVE: To identify and create the largest directory of emergency physicians on Twitter, analyse their user accounts and reveal details behind their connections.

METHODS: Several web search tools were used to identify emergency physicians on Twitter with biographies completely or partially written in English. NodeXL software was used to calculate emergency physicians' Twitter network metrics and create visualisation graphs.

RESULTS: The authors found 672 Twitter accounts of self-identified emergency physicians. Protected accounts were excluded from the study, leaving 632 for further analysis. Most emergency physicians were located in USA (55.4\%), had created their accounts in 2009 (43.4\%), used their full personal name (77.5\%) and provided a custom profile picture (92.2\%). Based on at least one published tweet in the last 15 days, there were 345 (54.6\%) active users on 31 December 2011. Active users mostly used mobile devices based on the Apple operating system to publish tweets (69.2\%). Visualisation of emergency physicians' Twitter network revealed many users with no connections with their colleagues, and a small group of most influential users who were highly interconnected.

CONCLUSIONS: Only a small proportion of registered emergency physicians use Twitter. Among them exists a smaller inner network of emergency physicians with strong social bonds that is using Twitter's full potentials for professional development.},

the educational arena on daily basis. However, in spite of growing popularity of
personal use of these social media, a low percentage of students and instructors use

correlational survey research design, which is 'expost

(t=2.37, df= 148, P {\textless}0.05), institution (t=3.09, df= 148, P {\textless}0.05). Social media usage is
indispensable in the contemporary academic works. Scholarly works through social
media usage will enable faculties to keep abreast of latest trends in their various

	title = {Correlation and interaction visualization of altmetric indicators extracted from scholarly social network activities: dimensions and structure.},
	volume = {15},
	doi = {10.2196/jmir.2707},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Citation counts for peer-reviewed articles and the impact factor of journals have long been indicators of article importance or quality. In the Web 2.0 era, growing numbers of scholars are using scholarly social network tools to communicate scientific ideas with colleagues, thereby making traditional indicators less sufficient, immediate, and comprehensive. In these new situations, the altmetric indicators offer alternative measures that reflect the multidimensional nature of scholarly impact in an immediate, open, and individualized way. In this direction of research, some studies have demonstrated the correlation between altmetrics and traditional metrics with different samples. However, up to now, there has been relatively little research done on the dimension and interaction structure of altmetrics.

OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to reveal the number of dimensions that altmetric indicators should be divided into and the structure in which altmetric indicators interact with each other.

METHODS: Because an article-level metrics dataset is collected from scholarly social media and open access platforms, it is one of the most robust samples available to study altmetric indicators. Therefore, we downloaded a large dataset containing activity data in 20 types of metrics present in 33,128 academic articles from the application programming interface website. First, we analyzed the correlation among altmetric indicators using Spearman rank correlation. Second, we visualized the multiple correlation coefficient matrixes with graduated colors. Third, inputting the correlation matrix, we drew an MDS diagram to demonstrate the dimension for altmetric indicators. For correlation structure, we used a social network map to represent the social relationships and the strength of relations.

RESULTS: We found that the distribution of altmetric indicators is significantly non-normal and positively skewed. The distribution of downloads and page views follows the Pareto law. Moreover, we found that the Spearman coefficients from 91.58\% of the pairs of variables indicate statistical significance at the .01 level. The non-metric MDS map divided the 20 altmetric indicators into three clusters: traditional metrics, active altmetrics, and inactive altmetrics. The social network diagram showed two subgroups that are tied to each other but not to other groups, thus indicating an intersection between altmetrics and traditional metric indicators.

CONCLUSIONS: Altmetrics complement, and most correlate significantly with, traditional measures. Therefore, in future evaluations of the social impact of articles, we should consider not only traditional metrics but also active altmetrics. There may also be a transfer phenomenon for the social impact of academic articles. The impact transfer path has transfer, or intermediate, stations that transport and accelerate article social impact from active altmetrics to traditional metrics and vice versa. This discovery will be helpful to explain the impact transfer mechanism of articles in the Web 2.0 era. Hence, altmetrics are in fact superior to traditional filters for assessing scholarly impact in multiple dimensions and in terms of social structure.},

two usage measures and the citation impact of the analysed information systems articles.
As expected, downloads and citations have different obsolescence characteristics. While
the highest number of downloads are usually made in the publication year and immediately
afterwards, it takes several years until the citation maximum is reached. Furthermore, there

The majority of users are PhD and postgraduate students as well as postdocs. Correlations with citations are overall positive, with reading patterns of PhD students and postdocs being in general more similar to citation patterns than that of other professionals and librarians, which reflects expected usage behavior. Important differences concerning these results can be observed between particular research fields, reflecting the particular usage patterns of certain user groups as well as the general uptake of Mendeley in these fields. Most importantly it is shown that differences between usage behavior of user types cannot be accurately determined, as Mendeley only provides only the top 3 user types per document. Introduction},

We have analyzed a set of publications with doi number indexed in the Web of Science during the period 2011-2013 and collected their data with the Altmetric API. 19\% of the original set of papers was retrieved from Altmetric.com including some altmetric data. We identified 16 different social media sources from which Altmetric.com retrieves data. However five of them cover 95.5\% of the total set. Twitter (87.1\%) and Mendeley (64.8\%) have the highest coverage. We conclude that Altmetric.com is a transparent, rich and accurate tool for altmetric data. Nevertheless, there are still potential limitations on its exhaustiveness as well as on the selection of social media sources that need further research.},

	abstract = {One hundred scientific and scholarly journal web sites were investigated to find out their
use of social media tools and to examine attention data revealed by them. Seventy-eight
scientific journals used social media tools, RSS being the most common. Interactive social
media tools – Facebook, Twitter and blogs – were present on 19 journal web sites. Attention
data were operationalised as liking, commenting or sharing postings on Facebook, Twitter
or blog texts or linking to articles, liking a YouTube entry or following a journal on Twitter.
Facebook and blog sites of the journals had varying roles with respect to content generated
by readers and the journal, and the amount of attention data received by the journals’
Facebook, Twitter and blog sites also showed great variation. In scientific communication,
social media have a role of their own, complementing that of scientific journals, and their
active use indicates the clear demand for them. Attention is difficult to measure also by
social media, but their interactive features obviously indicate one part of it, and attention
economy presents a fruitful viewpoint for studying scientific communication by providing
relevant and useful concepts that describe its characteristics and factors that influence the
attention it receives.},

project Trust and Authority in Scholarly Communications in the Light of the
Digital Transition. It provides for an examination of the behaviours and attitudes
of academic researchers as producers and consumers of scholarly information
resources in the digital era in respect to how they determine authority and
trustworthiness in the sources they use, cite, and publish in. The fi rst phase of
the study utilized focus groups to formulate research questions for the project
as a whole. It provided the direction for the literature review, interviews, and
questionnaires studies that would follow. Fourteen focus groups were held in the
UK and US in order to obtain this information. A total of 66 science and social
science researchers participated. The main fi ndings were: (a) researchers play
down diffi culties of establishing trustworthiness, not because there are none, but
because they have well-developed methods of establishing trust; (b) citationderived
metrics are becoming more important in regard to where researchers
publish; (c) social media are ancillary to research, but are used for promotion of
research and idea generation; (d) researchers are suspicious and confused about
open access, but less so if produced by a traditional publisher; (e) there was a
uniformity of perceptions/behaviour of researchers irrespective of differences in
subject, country, and age; (f) although some early career researchers behave the
same as their more senior colleagues this is because of a fear of the system: they
actually think differently.},

	abstract = {Although Mendeley bookmarking counts appear to correlate moderately with
conventional citation metrics, it is not known whether academic publications are
bookmarked in Mendeley in order to be read or not. Without this information, it is not
possible to give a confident interpretation of altmetrics derived from Mendeley. In
response, a survey of 860 Mendeley users shows that it is reasonable to use Mendeley
bookmarking counts as an indication of readership because most (55\%) users with a
Mendeley library had read or intended to read at least half of their bookmarked
publications. This was true across all broad areas of scholarship except for the arts and
humanities (42\%). About 85\% of the respondents also declared that they bookmarked
articles in Mendeley to cite them in their publications, but some also bookmark articles
for use in professional (50\%), teaching (25\%) and educational activities (13\%). Of
course, it is likely that most readers do not record articles in Mendeley and so this data
does not represent all readers. In conclusion, Mendeley bookmark counts seem to be
indicators of readership leading to a combination of scholarly impact and wider
professional impact.},

	title = {Can tweets predict citations? {Metrics} of social impact based on {Twitter} and correlation with traditional metrics of scientific impact.},
	volume = {13},
	doi = {10.2196/jmir.2012},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Citations in peer-reviewed articles and the impact factor are generally accepted measures of scientific impact. Web 2.0 tools such as Twitter, blogs or social bookmarking tools provide the possibility to construct innovative article-level or journal-level metrics to gauge impact and influence. However, the relationship of the these new metrics to traditional metrics such as citations is not known.

OBJECTIVE: (1) To explore the feasibility of measuring social impact of and public attention to scholarly articles by analyzing buzz in social media, (2) to explore the dynamics, content, and timing of tweets relative to the publication of a scholarly article, and (3) to explore whether these metrics are sensitive and specific enough to predict highly cited articles.

METHODS: Between July 2008 and November 2011, all tweets containing links to articles in the Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR) were mined. For a subset of 1573 tweets about 55 articles published between issues 3/2009 and 2/2010, different metrics of social media impact were calculated and compared against subsequent citation data from Scopus and Google Scholar 17 to 29 months later. A heuristic to predict the top-cited articles in each issue through tweet metrics was validated.

RESULTS: A total of 4208 tweets cited 286 distinct JMIR articles. The distribution of tweets over the first 30 days after article publication followed a power law (Zipf, Bradford, or Pareto distribution), with most tweets sent on the day when an article was published (1458/3318, 43.94\% of all tweets in a 60-day period) or on the following day (528/3318, 15.9\%), followed by a rapid decay. The Pearson correlations between tweetations and citations were moderate and statistically significant, with correlation coefficients ranging from .42 to .72 for the log-transformed Google Scholar citations, but were less clear for Scopus citations and rank correlations. A linear multivariate model with time and tweets as significant predictors (P {\textless} .001) could explain 27\% of the variation of citations. Highly tweeted articles were 11 times more likely to be highly cited than less-tweeted articles (9/12 or 75\% of highly tweeted article were highly cited, while only 3/43 or 7\% of less-tweeted articles were highly cited; rate ratio 0.75/0.07 = 10.75, 95\% confidence interval, 3.4-33.6). Top-cited articles can be predicted from top-tweeted articles with 93\% specificity and 75\% sensitivity.

CONCLUSIONS: Tweets can predict highly cited articles within the first 3 days of article publication. Social media activity either increases citations or reflects the underlying qualities of the article that also predict citations, but the true use of these metrics is to measure the distinct concept of social impact. Social impact measures based on tweets are proposed to complement traditional citation metrics. The proposed twimpact factor may be a useful and timely metric to measure uptake of research findings and to filter research findings resonating with the public in real time.},

Ghost authorship, however, is only one sort of ghosting. In this article, we present evidence that pharmaceutical companies engage in the ghost management of the scientific literature, by controlling or shaping several crucial steps in the research, writing, and publication of scientific articles. Ghost management allows the pharmaceutical industry to shape the literature in ways that serve its interests. This article aims to reinforce and expand publication ethics as an important area of concern for bioethics. Since ghost-managed research is primarily undertaken in the interests of marketing, large quantities of medical research violate not just publication norms but also research ethics. Much of this research involves human subjects, and yet is performed not primarily to increase knowledge for broad human benefit, but to disseminate results in the service of profits. Those who sponsor, manage, conduct, and publish such research therefore behave unethically, since they put patients at risk without justification. This leads us to a strong conclusion: if medical journals want to ensure that the research they publish is ethically sound, they should not publish articles that are commercially sponsored.},

Two of the prevalent author ordering schemes are alphabetical, which involves listing authors in lexicograph- ical order of their last names, implying that all contributed equally, and by contribution, where authors are listed in decreasing order of their contribution to the paper. We perform a game theoretic analysis of the impact of author ordering schemes, uncovering two considerable advantages of alphabetical ordering: it leads to improved research quality, and it is the more fair of the two approaches in the worst case. On the other hand, contribution- based ordering results in a denser collaboration network and a greater number of publications than is achieved using alphabetical author ordering. Furthermore, authors can overcome some of the limitations of contribution-based ordering by performing rotations, alternating who is the first author on joint papers. This often allows authors to achieve optimal research quality and perfect fairness under any given contribution scheme; however, this is obtained at the expense of truthfulness.},

	abstract = {Performing exhaustive searches over a large number of text documents can be tedious, since it is very hard to formulate search queries or define filter criteria that capture an analyst's information need adequately. Classification through machine learning has the potential to improve search and filter tasks encompassing either complex or very specific information needs, individually. Unfortunately, analysts who are knowledgeable in their field are typically not machine learning specialists. Most classification methods, however, require a certain expertise regarding their parametrization to achieve good results. Supervised machine learning algorithms, in contrast, rely on labeled data, which can be provided by analysts. However, the effort for labeling can be very high, which shifts the problem from composing complex queries or defining accurate filters to another laborious task, in addition to the need for judging the trained classifier's quality. We therefore compare three approaches for interactive classifier training in a user study. All of the approaches are potential candidates for the integration into a larger retrieval system. They incorporate active learning to various degrees in order to reduce the labeling effort as well as to increase effectiveness. Two of them encompass interactive visualization for letting users explore the status of the classifier in context of the labeled documents, as well as for judging the quality of the classifier in iterative feedback loops. We see our work as a step towards introducing user controlled classification methods in addition to text search and filtering for increasing recall in analytics scenarios involving large corpora.},

Past interest in such document sets has spurred the development of numerous visualization approaches for their interactive analysis. They either focus on the textual content of publications, or on document metadata including authors and citations. Previously presented approaches for citation analysis aim primarily at the visualization of the structure of citation networks and their exploration. We extend the state-of-the-art by presenting an approach for the interactive visual analysis of the contents of scientific documents, and combine it with a new and flexible technique to analyze their citations. This technique facilitates user-steered aggregation of citations which are linked to the content of the citing publications using a highly interactive visualization approach. Through enriching the approach with additional interactive views of other important aspects of the data, we support the exploration of the dataset over time and enable users to analyze citation patterns, spot trends, and track long-term developments. We demonstrate the strengths of our approach through a use case and discuss it based on expert user feedback.},

A growing emphasis on open science and reproducibility is changing how authors cite and acknowledge “research infrastructures”—entities that are used as inputs to or as underlying foundations for scholarly research, including data sets, software packages, computational models, observational platforms, and computing facilities. At the same time, stakeholder interest in quantitative understanding of impact is spurring increased collection and analysis of metrics related to use of research infrastructures. This article reviews work spanning several decades on tracing and assessing the outcomes and impacts from these kinds of research infrastructures. We discuss how research infrastructures are identified and referenced by scholars in the research literature and how those references are being collected and analyzed for the purposes of evaluating impact. Synthesizing common features of a wide range of studies, we identify notable challenges that impede the analysis of impact metrics for research infrastructures and outline key open research questions that can guide future research and applications related to such metrics.},

	abstract = {After a spectacular case of data fraud in the field of social psychology surfaced in The Netherlands in September 2011, the Dutch research community was confronted with a number of questions. Is this an isolated case or is scientific fraud with data more common? Is the scientific method robust enough to uncover the results of misconduct and to withstand the breach of trust that fraud causes? How responsible and reliable are researchers when they collect, process, analyse and report on data? How can we prevent data fraud? Do we need to adapt the codes of conduct for researchers or do we need stricter rules for data management and data sharing? This paper discusses the conclusions and recommendations of two reports that were published recently in consequence of this data fraud. The reports are relevant for scientific integrity and trustworthy treatment of research data. Next, this paper reports on the outcomes of enquiries in data cultures in a number of scientific disciplines. The concluding section of this paper contains a number of examples that show that the approach towards data sharing is improving gradually. The data fraud case can be regarded as a wake-up call.},

	abstract = {We must all accept that science is data and that data are science, and thus provide for, and justify the need for the support of, much-improved data curation. (Hanson, Sugden, \& Alberts, ) Researchers are producing an unprecedented deluge of data by using new methods and instrumentation. Others may wish to mine these data for new discoveries and innovations. However, research data are not readily available as sharing is common in only a few fields such as astronomy and genomics. Data sharing practices in other fields vary widely. Moreover, research data take many forms, are handled in many ways, using many approaches, and often are difficult to interpret once removed from their initial context. Data sharing is thus a conundrum. Four rationales for sharing data are examined, drawing examples from the sciences, social sciences, and humanities: (1) to reproduce or to verify research, (2) to make results of publicly funded research available to the public, (3) to enable others to ask new questions of extant data, and (4) to advance the state of research and innovation. These rationales differ by the arguments for sharing, by beneficiaries, and by the motivations and incentives of the many stakeholders involved. The challenges are to understand which data might be shared, by whom, with whom, under what conditions, why, and to what effects. Answers will inform data policy and practice.},

	abstract = {Points to weaknesses in earlier studies of the effect of fines on modifying user behaviour and the length of overdues, due to their synchronic nature: whereby libraries examine a 'snapshot' of the overdue rates of several sets of circulating items at a given time, instead of following the progress of one set of circulated items through the overdues process. The imposition of fines, in the Briscoe Library, Texas University at San Antonio, Health Science Center, in Summer 1990, following introduction of a new automated library system, enabled the collection of data on the impact of fines, both at the time and several years later, in a 'diachronic' fashion by examining a single set of circulating items through the circulation process. Concludes that high variances in the samples suggest that many other factors besides fines are at work in determining when users return materials. Convenience of renewal and return are likely factors, but the 2 largest determinants are probably: simple conscientiousness; and when the user has finished with the item.

The study reported here surveyed students' perception of increases in fines imposed by the management of Hezekiah Oluwasanmi Library in the academic year 2002/2003. 1,500 respondents were given a structured questionnaire to complete and return between September and November, 2004. The respondents perceived the increase as a welcome measure, long overdue, which would make library books more readily available and accessible. There was no gender bias in their reaction. It is therefore concluded that fines should be imposed to meet the information needs of the users. It is recommended that a periodic review of the measure should be carried out and that early completion of library automation, especially circulation operations, is essential.},

These applications can lead to significant savings in labour costs, enhance customer service, and lower book theft and can provide a constant record update of media collections. In this paper the components and technical features of a modern RFID library system are described to provide a guideline for the evaluation of different systems. A short report of three installations in Europe (one university library and two public libraries) is also provided. It is noted that an important point is that non-proprietary systems can be used for libraries today since the new generation of RFID-chips with the ISO standard 15693 are available. With this technology libraries are not dependent on one company for their lifeline. - See more at: http://0-www.emeraldinsight.com.library.ada.edu.az/journals.htm?issn=0264-0473\&volume=22\&issue=4\&articleid=862066\&show=abstract\#sthash.UF8kiZj0.dpuf},

The empirical findings are conceptualized in a model where research collaboration is suggested to be understood as dependent on how the reasons, forms and effects respectively vary. The collaborations are characterized by strong pragmatism and a high degree of self-organization. Finally, the science policy implications of this study are discussed.

	abstract = {This paper explores recent trends in the size of scientific teams and in institutional collaborations. The data derive from 2.4 million scientific papers written in 110 top U.S. research universities over the period 1981-1999. The top 110 account for a large share of published basic research conducted in the U.S. during this time. We measure team size by the number of authors on a scientific paper. Using this measure we find that team size increases by 50\% over the 19-year period. We supplement team size with measures of domestic and foreign institutional collaborations, which capture the geographic dispersion of team workers. The time series evidence suggests that the trend towards more geographically dispersed scientific teams accelerates beginning with papers published at the start of the 1990s. This acceleration suggests a sharp decline in the cost of collaboration. Our hypothesis is that the decline is due to the deployment of the National Science Foundation's NSFNET and its connection to networks in Europe and Japan after 1987. Using a panel of top university departments we also find that private universities and departments whose scientists have earned prestigious awards participate in larger teams, as do departments that have larger amounts of federal funding. Placement of former graduate students is a key determinant of institutional collaborations, especially collaborations with firms and with foreign scientific institutions. Finally, the evidence suggests that scientific output and influence increase with team size and that influence rises along, with institutional collaborations. Since increasing team size implies an increase in the division of labor, these results suggest that scientific productivity increases with the scientific division of labor. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {This paper estimates the "production function" for scientific research publications in the field of biotechnology. It utilises an exceptionally rich and comprehensive data set pertaining to the universe of research groups that applied to a 1989-1993 research programme in biotechnology and bio-instrumentation, sponsored by the Italian National Research Council, CNR. A structural model of the resource allocation process in scientific research guides the selection of instruments in the econometric analysis, and controls for selectivity bias effects on estimates based on the performance of funded research units. The average elasticity of research output with respect to the research budget is estimated to be 0.6; but, for a small fraction of groups led by highly prestigious Pls this elasticity approaches 1. These estimates imply, conditional on the distribution of observed productivity, that a more unequal distribution of research funds would increase research output in the short-run. Past research publication performance is found to have an important effect on expected levels of grant funding, and hence on the unit's current productivity in terms of (quality adjusted) publications. The results show that the productivity of aggregate resource expenditures supporting scientific research is critically dependent on the Institutional mechanisms and criteria employed in the allocation of such resources.},

	abstract = {Objective To introduce the availability of grant-to-article linkage data associated with National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants and to perform a high-level analysis of the publication outputs and impacts associated with those grants. Design Articles were linked to the grants they acknowledge using the grant acknowledgment strings in PubMed using a parsing and matching process as embodied in the NIH Scientific Publication Information Retrieval \&amp; Evaluation System system. Additional data from PubMed and citation counts from Scopus were added to the linkage data. The data comprise 2 572 576 records from 1980 to 2009. Results The data show that synergies between NIH institutes are increasing over time; 29\% of current articles acknowledge grants from multiple institutes. The median time lag to publication for a new grant is 3 years. Each grant contributes to approximately 1.7 articles per year, averaged over all grant types. Articles acknowledging US Public Health Service (PHS, which includes NIH) funding are cited twice as much as US-authored articles acknowledging no funding source. Articles acknowledging both PHS funding and a non-US government funding source receive on average 40\% more citations that those acknowledging PHS funding sources alone. Conclusion The US PHS is effective at funding research with a higher-than-average impact. The data are amenable to further and much more detailed analysis. Keywords},

To shed empirical light on this phenomenon, we investigate how the scientific community's perception of a scientist's prior work changes when one of his articles is retracted. Relative to non-retracted control authors, faculty members who experience a retraction see the citation rate to their articles drop by 10\% on average, consistent with the Bayesian intuition that the market inferred their work was mediocre all along. We then investigate whether the eminence of the retracted author, and the publicity surrounding the retraction, shape the magnitude of the penalty. We find that eminent scientists are more harshly penalized than their less-distinguished peers in the wake of a retraction, but only in cases involving fraud or misconduct. When the retraction event had it source in "honest mistakes," we find no evidence of differential stigma between high-and low-status faculty members.},

	abstract = {The implementation of a Bayh–Dole-like legislation outside the US is still a major concern that needs to be addressed. I fill this gap in two ways. First, I report the results of a faculty survey on obstacles to patenting activity in Italian universities, targeted both to inventors and to those non-inventors which reported to engage in university patenting activity and to give up before any patents could be filed. Second, I investigate their effect in a regression model using universities’ patent counts as the dependent variable. Results show that obstacles to university patenting activity reduce to four dimensions: lack of support mechanisms (including insufficient reward for researchers, lack of a TTO, lack of funds to cover patenting costs), commercialisation problems, too heavy teaching and administrative duties, and personal/cultural problems (related to the scarce knowledge of institutional-level patent regulations and to the “open science” mentality of the university). Among them, however, only the lack of support by the university administration reduces the patent counts. Publication productivity has an inverted U-shaped relation with patent counts, but the overall effect is still largely positive, given the current publication levels.},

To test and model these questions, this paper uses data collected in a 20042005 survey by the Research Valuing Mapping Project (a project based at Georgia Tech and led by Barry Bozeman) of 2,086 academically based research scientists and engineers. The analysis in this paper reaffirms the positive relationship between federal funding and collaboration seen in previous works, but the findings suggest that there is in fact a threshold effectas the positive relationship has a diminishing influence. The findings of this paper are more limited with respect to how academic disciplines threshold levels differ. The results indicate a difference in the threshold levels between disciplines for three of the eight models.},

	abstract = {We surveyed 113 astronomers and 82 psychologists active in applying for federally funded research on their grant-writing history between January, 2009 and November, 2012. We collected demographic data, effort levels, success rates, and perceived non-financial benefits from writing grant proposals. We find that the average proposal takes 116 PI hours and 55 CI hours to write; although time spent writing was not related to whether the grant was funded. Effort did translate into success, however, as academics who wrote more grants received more funding. Participants indicated modest non-monetary benefits from grant writing, with psychologists reporting a somewhat greater benefit overall than astronomers. These perceptions of non-financial benefits were unrelated to how many grants investigators applied for, the number of grants they received, or the amount of time they devoted to writing their proposals. We also explored the number of years an investigator can afford to apply unsuccessfully for research grants and our analyses suggest that funding rates below approximately 20\%, commensurate with current NIH and NSF funding, are likely to drive at least half of the active researchers away from federally funded research. We conclude with recommendations and suggestions for individual investigators and for department heads.},

However, we continue to wrestle with allocating credit to the coauthors of publications with multiple authors, because the relative contribution of each author is difficult to determine. At the same time, the scientific community runs an informal field-dependent credit allocation process that assigns credit in a collective fashion to each work. Here we develop a credit allocation algorithm that captures the coauthors’ contribution to a publication as perceived by the scientific community, reproducing the informal collective credit allocation of science. We validate the method by identifying the authors of Nobel-winning papers that are credited for the discovery, independent of their positions in the author list. The method can also compare the relative impact of researchers working in the same field, even if they did not publish together. The ability to accurately measure the relative credit of researchers could affect many aspects of credit allocation in science, potentially impacting hiring, funding, and promotion decisions.},

At the same time bibliometric researchers have advised that co-authorship based indicators should be handled with care as a source of evidence on actual scientific collaboration. The aim of this study is to assess how well university-industry collaborations can be identified and described using co-authorship data. This is done through a comparison of co-authorship data with industrial funding to a medical university. In total 436 companies were identified through the two methods. Our results show that one third of the companies that have provided funding to the university had not co-authored any publications with the university. Further, the funding indicator identified only 16\% of the companies that had co-authored publications. Thus, both co-authorship and funding indicators provide incomplete results. We also observe a case of conflicting trends between funding and co-authorship indicators. We conclude that uncritical use of the two indicators may lead to misinterpretation of the development of collaborations and thus provide incorrect data for decision-making. © Springer-Verlag/Akadémiai Kiadó 2006.},

A questionnaire was developed to investigate the impact of different media as a tool to broker contact between researchers and a variety of different stakeholders (for example, publics, other researchers, policymakers, journalists) as well as how researchers perceive that their use of these media has changed over the past five years. The questionnaire was sent to 504 researchers whose work had featured in a policy-oriented e-news service. 149 valid responses were received (29\%). Coverage in traditional media (newspapers, broadcast) not only brokers contact with other journalists, but is a good source of contact from other researchers (n=47, 62\%) and members of the public (n=36, 26\%). Although the use of social media was limited amongst our sample, it did broker contact with other researchers (n=17, 47\%) and the public (n=10, 28\%). Nevertheless, few environmental researchers were actively using social media to disseminate their research findings, with many continuing to rely on academic journals and face-to-face communication to reach both academic and public audiences.},

	abstract = {Social-media-supported academic conferences are
becoming increasingly global as people anywhere can participate
actively through backchannel conversation. It can be challenging
for the conference organizers to integrate the use of social media,
to take advantage of the connections between backchannel and
front stage, and to encourage the participants to be a part
of the broader discussion occurring through social media. The
backchannel conversation during academic conference can offer
key insights on best practices, and specialized tools and methods
are needed to analyze this data. In this paper we present our
two fold contribution to enable organizers to gain such insights.
First, we introduce Conference Monitor (CM), a real time webbased
tweet visualization dashboard to monitor the backchannel
conversation during academic conferences. We demonstrate the
features of CM, which are designed to help monitor academic
conferences, and its application during the conference Theorizing
the Web 2012 (TtW12). Its real time visualizations helped identify
the popular sessions, the active and important participants, and
trending topics. Second, we report on our retrospective analysis
of the tweets about the TtW12 conference and the conferencerelated
follower-networks. The 4828 tweets from 593 participants
resulted in 8.14 tweets per participant. The 1591 new followerrelations
created among the participants during the conference
confirmed the overall high volume of new connections created
during academic conferences. On average a speaker got more
new followers than a non-speaker. A few remote participants
also gained comparatively large number of new followers due to
the content of their tweets and their perceived importance. There
was a positive correlation between the number of new followers of
a participant and the number of people who mentioned him/her.
Remote participants had a significant level of participation in the
backchannel and live streaming helped them to be more engaged.},

users, the reasons for its use, its perceived benefits and the use of other social media for scholarly
purposes.
Design/methodology/approach – The authors examined the profiles of the users of an academic
social network. The users were affiliated with 12 universities. The following were recorded for each
user: sex, the number of documents uploaded, the number of followers, and the number of people being
followed. In addition, a survey was sent to the individuals who had an email address in their profile.
Findings – Half of the users of the social network were academics and a third were PhD students.
Social sciences scholars accounted for nearly half of all users. Academics used the service to get in
touch with other scholars, disseminate research results and follow other scholars. Other widely
employed social media included citation indexes, document creation, edition and sharing tools and
communication tools. Users complained about the lack of support for the utilisation of these tools.
Research limitations/implications – The results are based on a single case study.
Originality/value – This study provides new insights on the impact of social media in academic
contexts by analysing the user profiles and benefits of a social network service that is specifically
targeted at the academic community.

	volume = {1},
	doi = {10.3402/meo.v18i0.20995},
	abstract = {Purpose: The difficulty of attracting attendance for in-person events is a problem common to all faculty
development efforts. Social media holds the potential to disseminate information asynchronously while
building a community through quick, easy-to-use formats. The authors sought to document creative uses of
social media for faculty development in academic medical centers.
Method: In December 2011, the first author (P.S.C.) examined the websites of all 154 accredited medical
schools in the United States and Canada for pages relevant to faculty development. The most popular social
media sites and searched for accounts maintained by faculty developers in academic medicine were also
visited. Several months later, in February 2012, a second investigator (C.W.S.) validated these data via an
independent review.
Results: Twenty-two (22) medical schools (14.3\%) employed at least one social media technology in support of
faculty development. In total, 40 instances of social media tools were identified ⬚ the most popular platforms
being Facebook (nine institutions), Twitter (eight institutions), and blogs (eight institutions). Four medical
schools, in particular, have developed integrated strategies to engage faculty in online communities.
Conclusions: Although relatively few medical schools have embraced social media to promote faculty
development, the present range of such uses demonstrates the flexibility and affordability of the tools. The
most popular tools incorporate well into faculty members’ existing use of technology and require minimal
additional effort. Additional research into the benefits of engaging faculty through social media may help
overcome hesitation to invest in new technologies.},

We analyzed the 2013 Association of Program Directors in Internal Medicine Twitter community. We measured the number of tweets authored by each participant and the number of amplified tweets (re-tweets). We developed a multivariate linear regression model to identify any relationship to social media influence, measured by the PageRank. Faculty (from academic institutions) comprised 19\% of the 132 participants in the learning community (p {\textless} 0.0001). Faculty authored 49\% of all 867 tweets (p {\textless} 0.0001). Their tweets were the most likely to be amplified (52\%, p {\textless} 0.01). Faculty had the greatest influence amongst all participants (mean 1.99, p {\textless} 0.0001). Being a faculty member had no predictive effect on influence (β = 0.068, p = 0.6). The only factors that predicted influence (higher PageRank) were the number of tweets authored (p {\textless} 0.0001) and number of tweets amplified (p {\textless} 0.0001) The status of "faculty member" did not confer a greater influence. Any participant who was able to author the greatest number of tweets or have more of his/her tweets amplified could wield a greater influence on the participants, regardless of his/her authority.},

	abstract = {The article‑level metrics (ALMs) or altmetrics becomes a new trendsetter in recent times for measuring the impact of
scientific publications and their social outreach to intended audiences. The popular social networks such as Facebook,
Twitter, and Linkedin and social bookmarks such as Mendeley and CiteULike are nowadays widely used for communicating
research to larger transnational audiences. In 2012, the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment got signed by
the scientific and researchers communities across the world. This declaration has given preference to the ALM or altmetrics
over traditional but faulty journal impact factor (JIF)‑based assessment of career scientists. JIF does not consider impact
or influence beyond citations count as this count reflected only through Thomson Reuters’ Web of Science® database.
Furthermore, JIF provides indicator related to the journal, but not related to a published paper. Thus, altmetrics now becomes
an alternative metrics for performance assessment of individual scientists and their contributed scholarly publications.
This paper provides a glimpse of genesis of altmetrics in measuring efficacy of scholarly communications and highlights
available altmetric tools and social platforms linking altmetric tools, which are widely used in deriving altmetric scores of
scholarly publications. The paper thus argues for institutions and policy makers to pay more attention to altmetrics based
indicators for evaluation purpose but cautions that proper safeguards and validations are needed before their adoption.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Twitter is a social media microblogging platform that allows rapid exchange of information between individuals. Despite its widespread acceptance and use at various other medical specialty meetings, there are no published data evaluating its use at radiology meetings. The purpose of this study is to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the use of Twitter as a microblogging platform at recent RSNA annual meetings.

METHODS: Twitter activity meta-data tagged with official meeting hashtags \#RSNA11 and \#RSNA12 were collected and analyzed. Multiple metrics were evaluated, including daily and hourly Twitter activity, frequency of microblogging activity over time, characteristics of the 100 most active Twitter users at each meeting, characteristics of meeting-related tweets, and the geographic origin of meeting microbloggers.

RESULTS: The use of Twitter microblogging increased by at least 30\% by all identifiable meaningful metrics between the 2011 and 2012 RSNA annual meetings, including total tweets, tweets per day, activity of the most active microbloggers, and total number of microbloggers. Similar increases were observed in numbers of North American and international microbloggers.

CONCLUSION: Markedly increased use of the Twitter microblogging platform at recent RSNA annual meetings demonstrates the potential to leverage this technology to engage meeting attendees, improve scientific sessions, and promote improved collaboration at national radiology meetings.},

high impact factor, whereas articles with high impact could be published
in lower ranked journals or journals with low impact factor. Citation

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Faculty development (FD) is important for continued professional development, but expense and distance remain challenging. These challenges could be minimized by the free and asynchronous nature of social media (SM). We sought to determine the utility and effectiveness of conducting a national online FD activity on Facebook by assessing participants' perceptions and use and facilitators' challenges.

METHODS: An educational activity of a national FD program was managed on a closed Facebook group. Activities included postings of educational technology goals, abstracting an article, and commenting on peers' postings. Sources of quantitative data included the Facebook postings and the survey responses. Surveys before, after, and 6 months after the activity assessed knowledge, attitudes and self-reported behaviors. Sources of qualitative data were the open-ended survey questions and the content of the Facebook postings.

RESULTS: All participants completed the FD activity and evaluations, yielding 38 postings and 115 comments. Before the activity, 88\% had a personal Facebook account, 64\% were somewhat/very confident using Facebook, 77\% thought SM would be useful for professional networking, and 12\% had used it professionally. Six months after the activity, professional usage had increased to 35\%. Continued use of Facebook for future presentations of this FD activity was recommended by 76\%. Qualitative analysis yielded 12 types of Facebook postings and 7 themes related to using SM for FD.

CONCLUSIONS: Conducting a national FD activity on Facebook yielded excellent participation rates and positive participant impressions, and it affected professional usage. Facebook may become an additional tool in the educator's toolbox for FD as a result of its acceptability and accessibility.},

Nevertheless, it is not known whether tweets are typically positive, neutral or critical, or how articles are normally tweeted. These are problems for those wishing to tweet articles effectively and for those wishing to know whether tweet counts in digital libraries should be taken seriously. In response, a pilot study content analysis was conducted of 270 tweets linking to articles in four journals, four digital libraries and two DOI URLs, collected over a period of eight months in 2012. The vast majority of the tweets echoed an article title (42\%) or a brief summary (41\%). One reason for summarising an article seemed to be to translate it for a general audience. Few tweets explicitly praised an article and none were critical. Most tweets did not directly refer to the article author, but some did and others were clearly self-citations. In summary, tweets containing links to scholarly articles generally provide little more than publicity, and so whilst tweet counts may provide evidence of the popularity of an article, the contents of the tweets themselves are unlikely to give deep insights into scientists' reactions to publications, except perhaps in special cases.},

seniority was linked to the position of nodes within the network. The
survey revealed a contradiction between academics use of the sites and
their position within the networks the sites foster. Junior academics were
found to be more active users of the sites, agreeing to a greater extent

Altmetrics, metrics based on the social web, provide an opportunity both to more acutely measure the propagation of this communication and to reconsider how we measure research impact in general. While the use of social media and analytics and the structure of tenure and promotion practices are not consistent across or even within disciplines, the practices and experimentation of early adopters, from researchers and institutions to industry, yield stories, lessons learned, and practices worth investigating. Researchers and academic librarians both face new opportunities to engage and support the use of altmetrics tools and methods and to re-examine how scholarship is defined, collected, preserved, used, and discussed. This report summarizes the major trends, opportunities and challenges of altmetrics to both researchers and academic research libraries and outlines ways in which research libraries can participate in shaping this emergent field.

	doi = {10.1016/j.jss.2014.02.029},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Social media is a cornerstone of modern society and its use in health care has rapidly expanded in recent years. "Live Tweeting" of professional meetings is a growing way for participants to communicate with peers. The goal of this study was to analyze the initial experience with implementation of a Twitter Team at the 2013 Academic Surgical Congress (ASC).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four ASC attendees were designated as the "Twitter Team" for the 2013 meeting. Organizational leadership prominently promoted the unique meeting hashtag (\#2013ASC). Twdocs and TweetReach were used to aggregate data 1 wk after the meeting.

RESULTS: A total of 58 independent users posted tweets with the \#2013ASC hashtag during the week of the meeting. Total tweets numbered 434, with 288 original tweets. Of the 37 users who were identifiable individuals, 19 were in attendance at the ASC; 18 of the identifiable individuals were members of either the Association for Academic Surgery and/or the Society of University Surgeons. The ASC Twitter Team was responsible for 76\% of all \#2013ASC tweets. The three most common content areas for tweets were promotional (147), content related from presidential sessions (96), and social (75).

CONCLUSIONS: Twitter provides a meaningful social media format for sharing information during academic surgical meetings. The use of Twitter sharply expands the available audience for meeting proceedings and broadens the discussion venue for scholarly activity. "Tweeting the meeting" represents an important future direction for information dissemination in academic surgery.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) has increased its efforts to use its annual conference to inform
and educate the public about kidney disease. Social media, including Twitter, has been one method used by the Society to
accomplish this goal. Twitter is a popular microblogging service that serves as a potent tool for disseminating information. It
allows for short messages (140 characters) to be composed by any author and distributes those messages globally and
quickly. The dissemination of information is necessary if Twitter is to be considered a tool that can increase public
awareness of kidney disease. We hypothesized that content, citation, and sentiment analyses of tweets generated from
Kidney Week 2011 would reveal a large number of educational tweets that were disseminated to the public. An ideal tweet
for accomplishing this goal would include three key features: 1) informative content, 2) internal citations, and 3) positive
sentiment score. Informative content was found in 29\% of messages, greater than that found in a similarly sized medical
conference (2011 ADA Conference, 16\%). Informative tweets were more likely to be internally, rather than externally, cited
(38\% versus 22\%, p,0.0001), thereby amplifying the original information to an even larger audience. Informative tweets
had more negative sentiment scores than uninformative tweets (means 20.162 versus 0.199 respectively, p,0.0001),
therefore amplifying a tweet whose content had a negative tone. Our investigation highlights significant areas of promise
and improvement in using Twitter to disseminate medical information in nephrology from a scientific conference. This goal
is pertinent to many nephrology-focused conferences that wish to increase public awareness of kidney disease.},

	isbn = {978-1-908272-22-5},
	abstract = {This paper describes current doctoral research into how PhD students are using
social and participative media (web 2.0) in their academic studies. It examines the
role these media can play in identityformation
and induction into academic
scholarship and professional development. The highly contextualised and situated
approach of this study challenges some of the dominant discourses and idealised
concepts within the educational technology field to address the significant gap
between the potential of web 2.0 and the reality of low rates of adoption and use. The
study reconciles social media adoption and use with the selfefficacy
and
heterogeneity of doctoral practice. By taking an ecological approach, it recognises
that doing a PhD requires the negotiation of multiple and interrelated academic and
occasionally nonacademic
contexts. Such an approach legitimises doctoral practice
beyond those related purely to thesisdevelopment,
and challenges models of
doctoral education defined by a trajectory of increased participation and enculturation
within a single, localised institutional research community. In addition, rather than
focusing on one particular tool or platform, the study adopts a holistic perspective to
social media that recognises the multiplicity, interrelatedness and transiency of web
2.0. The empirical research uses a small sample of social sciences, humanities and
interdisciplinary PhD students as participants. Adopting a qualitative approach and
mixedmethod
design, data were collected through the observation of online activities
across a range of social media, participantreported
accounts, and a series of indepth
participant interviews. Activity theory is used to support a grounded and recursive
approach to analysing participantproduced
digital artefacts, field notes and interview
transcripts through open coding and thick description. From these data, an analytical
framework of interrelated objectoriented
activity systems was generated with which to
identify and describe shifting patterns in social media practice through key phases in
the participants' doctoral experiences, and across a range of academic contexts.
Emerging findings indicate the role of social media in contributing to, and revealing,
the tensions inherent in negotiating multiple and interrelated practice contexts through
boundary crossing and interdisciplinary activities. The study reveals how participation
in emergent online research networks and communities is enabling new forms of
engagement with the research field, often beyond the immediate scope of thesisrelated
work, and examines how this contributes to the act of mapping the research
field by providing additional insights into the sociocultural
infrastructure that
underpins academic discourse. It also highlights how the development of doctoral
social media practices and identity agendas are influenced by localised research
cultures and often compromised by ambiguous or perceived audiences.},

scientists have social web presences, focusing on one influential group: highly cited
researchers working at European institutions. It also assesses the impact of these presences.
We manually and systematically identified if the European highly cited researchers had
profiles in Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic Search, Mendeley, Academia and LinkedIn
or any content in SlideShare. We then used URL mentions and altmetric indicators to
assess the impact of the web presences found. Although most of the scientists had an
institutional website of some kind, few had created a profile in any social website investigated,
and LinkedIn—the only non-academic site in the list—was the most popular.
Scientists having one kind of social web profile were more likely to have another in many
cases, especially in the life sciences and engineering. In most cases it was possible to
estimate the relative impact of the profiles using a readily available statistic and there were
disciplinary differences in the impact of the different kinds of profiles. Most social web
profiles had some evidence of uptake, if not impact; nevertheless, the value of the indicators
used is unclear.},

This context requires new management systems to make scientific knowledge more accessible and useable, including new measures to evaluate the reach of scientific information.

	volume = {10},
	doi = {10.2196/jmir.1118},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Blogs are the major contributors to the large increase of new websites created each year. Most blogs allow readers to leave comments and, in this way, generate both conversation and encourage collaboration. Despite their popularity, however, little is known about blogs or their creators.

OBJECTIVES: To contribute to a better understanding of the medical blogosphere by investigating the characteristics of medical bloggers and their blogs, including bloggers' Internet and blogging habits, their motivations for blogging, and whether or not they follow practices associated with journalism.

METHODS: We approached 197 medical bloggers of English-language medical blogs which provided direct contact information, with posts published within the past month. The survey included 37 items designed to evaluate data about Internet and blogging habits, blog characteristics, blogging motivations, and, finally, the demographic data of bloggers. Pearson's Chi-Square test was used to assess the significance of an association between 2 categorical variables. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was utilized to reveal the relationship between participants' ages, as well as the number of maintained blogs, and their motivation for blogging. The Mann-Whitney U test was employed to reveal relationships between practices associated with journalism and participants' characteristics like gender and pseudonym use.

RESULTS: A total of 80 (42\%) of 197 eligible participants responded. The majority of responding bloggers were white (75\%), highly educated (71\% with a Masters degree or doctorate), male (59\%), residents of the United States (72\%), between the ages of 30 and 49 (58\%), and working in the healthcare industry (67\%). Most of them were experienced bloggers, with 23\% (18/80) blogging for 4 or more years, 38\% (30/80) for 2 or 3 years, 32\% (26/80) for about a year, and only 7\% (6/80) for 6 months or less. Those who received attention from the news media numbered 66\% (53/80). When it comes to best practices associated with journalism, the participants most frequently reported including links to original source of material and spending extra time verifying facts, while rarely seeking permission to post copyrighted material. Bloggers who have published a scientific paper were more likely to quote other people or media than those who have never published such a paper (U= 506.5, n(1)= 41, n(2)= 35, P= .016). Those blogging under their real name more often included links to original sources than those writing under a pseudonym (U= 446.5, n(1)= 58, n(2)= 19, P= .01). Major motivations for blogging were sharing practical knowledge or skills with others, influencing the way others think, and expressing oneself creatively.

CONCLUSIONS: Medical bloggers are highly educated and devoted blog writers, faithful to their sources and readers. Sharing practical knowledge and skills, as well as influencing the way other people think, were major motivations for blogging among our medical bloggers. Medical blogs are frequently picked up by mainstream media; thus, blogs are an important vehicle to influence medical and health policy.},

services allow researchers to store and share scientific literature online. By bookmarking
and tagging articles, academic prosumers generate new information about resources, i.e.
usage statistics and content description of scientific journals. Given the lack of global download
statistics, the authors propose the application of social bookmarking data to journal
evaluation. For a set of 45 physics journals all 13,608 bookmarks from CiteULike, Connotea
and BibSonomy to documents published between 2004 and 2008 were analyzed. This article
explores bookmarking data in STM and examines in how far it can be used to describe
the perception of periodicals by the readership. Four basic indicators are defined, which
analyze different aspects of usage: Usage Ratio, Usage Diffusion, Article Usage Intensity
and Journal Usage Intensity. Tags are analyzed to describe a reader-specific view on journal
content.},

empirical evidence is available concerning the prevalence of use among academic librarians. The objectives of
this study are: a) to identify the prevalence of social media used in Malaysian academic libraries; b) to examine
the reasons for creating a social media presence among academic libraries; and c) to understand the obstacles
to social media participation among academic librarians. Data were gathered via three focus study groups with
22 librarians from three research-intensive universities in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The results indicated that at
least four types of social media are deployed in libraries to reach out to the users: blogs, multimedia sharing
sites, social bookmarking and social networking sites (SNS). Facebook, Blog, Delicious, YouTube and Twitter
are the tools mainly adopted by these libraries. The motives for librarians to use social media were to promote
library services, manage organizational knowledge and receiving instant feedback from users. Workflow obstacles,
technology obstacles, organizational obstacles and personal obstacles deter librarians from participating in
social media. This study provides experiential evidence that Malaysian academic librarians are not very serious
in engaging themselves with social media. Library managements need to provide support to mobilize librarians
into a more active and participatory role in creating social media presence.},

	abstract = {Objective: Recent trends in social media and online access of publications have led
to new ways of assessing publication impact, using altmetrics. This study is a semiquantitative
comparison of two commonly used altmetric tools.
Research design and methods: As part of a publications-gap analysis, altmetrics
were assessed using Altmetric.com and ImpactStory.org. Here, we focus on
publications for one drug in phase 3 development. Additionally, Twitter activity
(tweet volume/sentiment) was assessed using Topsy.com.
Results: Results are presented in Table 1.
Conclusions: Altmetrics.com and ImpactStory.org report different aspects of
publication impact. Further, traditional impact measures, such as JIF, did not
equate to ImpactStory.com or Altmetric.com scores and calls into question their
value as qualitative impact tools. Topsy analysis highlighted that Twitter activity
focused around congress presentations and press releases rather than publications
(data not shown). Further research is required to assess the utility of altmetrics in
tracking publication impact.},

A series of insights from the sociology of scientific knowledge are used to develop the basis for a sociological understanding of the citation debate. In particular, it is suggested that when construed as a measurement technology, we can see how the very system of measuring and manipulating citations redefines the phenomenon it is supposed to measure.

	abstract = {The long-standing belief that age is negatively associated with scientific productivity and creativity is shown to be based upon incorrect analysis of data. Analysis of data from a cross-section of academic scientists in six different fields indicates that age has a slight curvilinear relationship with both quality and quantity of scientific output. These results are supported by an analysis of a cohort of mathematicians who received their Ph.D.'s between 1974 and 1950. There was no decline in the quality of work produced by these mathematicians as they progressed through their careers. Both the slight decrease in productivity over the age of 50 are explained by the operation of the scientific reward system. By encouraging those scientists who produce the most favorably received work and discouraging those who produce work that is not favorably received, the reward system works to reduce the number of scientists who are actively publishing. Those who continue to publish throughout their careers are a "residue" composed of the best members of their cohort. Increases in productivity through the thirties and into the forties are shown to be a result of command over the resources necessary to be highly productive. In the last part of the paper I examine the hypothesis that it should be easier for young scientists to make important discoveries in the more highly developed or codified sciences than in the less highly developed ones. The data do not support this hypothesis but, rather, suggest that scientists in all six fields are approximately equally likely to make important discoveries shortly after they receive their Ph.D.'s.},

A slight increase is demonstrated to have taken place in economics during the last 30 years (1978-2007). A substantial decrease is demonstrated to have taken place in information science during the same period. A possible explanation for the demonstrated difference could be that information scientists have been much more aware of the bibliometric consequences of being first author compared to their colleagues in comparable fields (e.g., economics).

	abstract = {What is an author? What is a text? At a time when the definition of "text" is expanding and the technology whereby texts are produced and disseminated is changing at an explosive rate, the ways "authorship" is defined and rights conferred upon authors must also be reconsidered. This volume argues that contemporary copyright law, rooted as it is in a nineteenth-century Romantic understanding of the author as a solitary creative genius, may be inapposite to the realities of cultural production. Drawing together distinguished scholars from literature, law, and the social sciences, the volume explores the social and cultural construction of authorship as a step toward redefining notions of authorship and copyright for today's world. These essays, illustrating cultural studies in action, are aggressively interdisciplinary and wide-ranging in topic and approach. Questions of collective and collaborative authorship in both contemporary and early modern contexts are addressed. Other topics include moral theory and authorship; copyright and the balance between competing interests of authors and the public; problems of international copyright; musical sampling and its impact on "fair use" doctrine; cinematic authorship; quotation and libel; alternative views of authorship as exemplified by nineteenth-century women's clubs and by the Renaissance commonplace book; authorship in relation to broadcast media and to the teaching of writing; and the material dimension of authorship as demonstrated by Milton's publishing contract.Contributors.

	abstract = {Purpose: Social media channels such as Twitter are gaining
increasing acceptance as mechanisms for instantaneous scientific
dialogue. Professional medical societies such as ASCO are
using social media to expand the reach of scientific communications
at and around their scientific meetings. This article examines
the how Twitter use by oncologists expanded at the ASCO
Annual Meetings from 2010 to 2011.
Methods: In both years, tweets that were specifically generated
by physicians and that incorporated the official meeting
hashtag were harvested from the public domain, and a discourse
analysis was performed by three independent raters. Follow-up
surveys were conducted to assess physician attitudes toward
Twitter and its potential role in clinical practice.
Results: A combined total of 12,644 tweets were analyzed for
2010 and 2011. Although the number of physicians authoring
tweets was small (14 in 2010, 34 in 2011), this group generated
nearly 29\% of the total meeting dialogue examined in this analysis in
2010 and 23\% in 2011. Physicians used Twitter for reporting clinical
news from scientific sessions, for discussions of treatment issues,
for promotion, and to provide social commentary. The tangible impact
of Twitter discussions on clinical practice remains unclear.
Conclusion: Despite the 140-character limit, Twitter was successfully
used by physicians at the 2010 and 2011 ASCO Annual
Meetings to engage in clinical discussions, whether or not an author
was on site as a live attendee. Twitter usage grew significantly from
2010 to 2011. Professional societies should monitor these phenomena
to enhance annual meeting attendee user experience.},

indicators provided by Altmetric.com across scientific

presence and density of social media altmetric counts
are still very low and not very frequent among scientific
publications, with 15\%–24\% of the publications presenting
some altmetric activity and concentrated on the
most recent publications, although their presence is
increasing over time. Publications from the social sciences,
humanities, and the medical and life sciences
show the highest presence of altmetrics, indicating their
potential value and interest for these fields. The analysis
of the relationships between altmetrics and citations
confirms previous claims of positive correlations but is
relatively weak, thus supporting the idea that altmetrics
do not reflect the same kind of impact as citations. Also,
altmetric counts do not always present a better filtering
of highly-cited publications than journal citation scores.
Altmetric scores (particularly mentions in blogs) are
able to identify highly-cited publications with higher
levels of precision than journal citation scores (JCS), but
they have a lower level of recall. The value of altmetrics
as a complementary tool of citation analysis is highlighted,
although more research is suggested to disentangle
the potential meaning and value of altmetric
indicators for research evaluation.},

analyze the contribution that social bookmarking systems can provide to the
problem of usage-based metrics for scientific evaluation. I suggest that
collaboratively aggregated metadata may help fill the gap between traditional
citation-based criteria and raw usage factors. I submit that bottom-up,
distributed evaluation models such as those afforded by social bookmarking
will challenge more traditional quality assessment models in terms of coverage,
efficiency and scalability. Services aggregating user-related quality indicators

	doi = {10.1002/asi.23252},
	abstract = {International collaboration tends to result in more highly
cited research and, partly as a result of this, many
research funding schemes are specifically international
in scope. Nevertheless, it is not clear whether this citation
advantage is the result of higher quality research or
due to other factors, such as a larger audience for the
publications. To test whether the apparent advantage of
internationally collaborative research may be due to
additional interest in articles from the countries of the
authors, this article assesses the extent to which the
national affiliations of the authors of articles affect
the national affiliations of their Mendeley readers. Based
on English-language Web of Science articles in 10 fields
from science, medicine, social science, and the humanities,
the results of statistical models comparing author
and reader affiliations suggest that, in most fields, Mendeley
users are disproportionately readers of articles
authored from within their own country. In addition,
there are several cases in which Mendeley users from
certain countries tend to ignore articles from specific
other countries, although it is not clear whether this
reflects national biases or different national specialisms
within a field. In conclusion, research funders should
not incentivize international collaboration on the basis
that it is, in general, higher quality because its higher
impact may be primarily due to its larger audience. Moreover,
authors should guard against national biases in
their reading to select only the best and most relevant
publications to inform their research.},

considerable scholarly attention, academics seem to have an incomplete

media. Without a thorough examination of how academics present themselves on
social media, our understanding of the online learning environment is limited. To
fill this void, this study aims to explore the following: (1) the content that college
professors provide and the strategy they employ to present it on social media; and
(2) how the public evaluates professors based on the content and strategy
presented on social media. This study utilizes two methods. First, it conducts a
content analysis of 2,783 pieces of microblog posts from 142 full-time
communication professors’ microblog accounts. Second, it conducts an online
experiment based on a between-subject factorial design of 2 (gender: male vs.
female) X 3 (topic: personal vs. professional vs. half-personal-half-professional)
X 2 (fans number: few vs. many) X 2 (title: junior lecturer vs. senior full professor).
The results indicate that “what the microblogger says” has little effect on the
respondents’ evaluations; instead, the question of “who they are” carries much
more weight. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0068914},
	abstract = {A barrier to dissemination of research is that it depends on the end-user searching for or 'pulling' relevant knowledge from the literature base. Social media instead 'pushes' relevant knowledge straight to the end-user, via blogs and sites such as Facebook and Twitter. That social media is very effective at improving dissemination seems well accepted, but, remarkably, there is no evidence to support this claim. We aimed to quantify the impact of social media release on views and downloads of articles in the clinical pain sciences. Sixteen PLOS ONE articles were blogged and released via Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and ResearchBlogging.org on one of two randomly selected dates. The other date served as a control. The primary outcomes were the rate of HTML views and PDF downloads of the article, over a seven-day period. The critical result was an increase in both outcome variables in the week after the blog post and social media release. The mean ± SD rate of HTML views in the week after the social media release was 18±18 per day, whereas the rate during the other three weeks was no more than 6±3 per day. The mean ± SD rate of PDF downloads in the week after the social media release was 4±4 per day, whereas the rate during the other three weeks was less than 1±1 per day (p{\textless}0.05 for all comparisons). However, none of the recognized measures of social media reach, engagement or virality related to either outcome variable, nor to citation count one year later (p{\textgreater}0.3 for all). We conclude that social media release of a research article in the clinical pain sciences increases the number of people who view or download that article, but conventional social media metrics are unrelated to the effect.},

researchers with a means to organize personal collections of online references with keywords
(tags) and to share these collections with others. One of the side-effects of the operation of these
systems is the generation of large, publicly accessible metadata repositories describing the
resources in the collections. In light of the well-known expansion of information in the life sciences
and the need for metadata to enhance its value, these repositories present a potentially valuable
new resource for application developers. Here we characterize the current contents of two
scientifically relevant metadata repositories created through social tagging. This investigation helps
to establish how such socially constructed metadata might be used as it stands currently and to
suggest ways that new social tagging systems might be designed that would yield better aggregate
products.
Results: We assessed the metadata that users of CiteULike and Connotea associated with
citations in PubMed with the following metrics: coverage of the document space, density of
metadata (tags) per document, rates of inter-annotator agreement, and rates of agreement with
MeSH indexing. CiteULike and Connotea were very similar on all of the measurements. In
comparison to PubMed, document coverage and per-document metadata density were much lower
for the social tagging systems. Inter-annotator agreement within the social tagging systems and the
agreement between the aggregated social tagging metadata and MeSH indexing was low though the
latter could be increased through voting.
Conclusion: The most promising uses of metadata from current academic social tagging
repositories will be those that find ways to utilize the novel relationships between users, tags, and
documents exposed through these systems. For more traditional kinds of indexing-based
applications (such as keyword-based search) to benefit substantially from socially generated
metadata in the life sciences, more documents need to be tagged and more tags are needed for
each document. These issues may be addressed both by finding ways to attract more users to
current systems and by creating new user interfaces that encourage more collectively useful
individual tagging behaviour.},

As the results show, Percentile in Subject Area achieves the highest correlation with F1000

	doi = {10.1097/TP.0000000000000307},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Traditional measures of the impact of published research, such as citation counts, are limited to measuring academic impact. The use of social media and other online tools as alternative measures of research impact is gaining popularity and used by leading medical journals.

METHODS: MEDLINE was searched for articles published with subject headings relating to solid organ transplantation between August 1, 2011, and July 31, 2012. Citation data were retrieved from SCOPUS, and statistics regarding mentions in social media, social bookmarking sites, news outlets, and expert recommendation sites were retrieved from the data at www.altmetric.com. Data were analyzed for associations between alternative metric data and citation rates.

RESULTS: The search retrieved 6,981 publications. Sixty-six percent of the articles had at least one citation. Mentions in social media were 19.3\%, 13.1\% had social bookmarks, 0.9\% had expert recommendations, and online news outlets picked up eight articles. Significantly higher citation rates were associated with mention in social media, expert recommendation, social bookmarking, and for articles identified as meta-analyses, multicenter studies, randomized controlled trials, and reviews (all P{\textless}0.001). The odds of an article being highly cited were significantly increased by a mention in social media (odds ratio, 2.58; P{\textless}0.001). Qualitative analysis suggests that article topics discussed on social media are more likely to relate to the more controversial and emotive areas of transplantation.

DISCUSSION: Social media and online attention act as early predictors of the impact of transplant research as measured by later citation rate. Blogging and expert recommendation, in particular, are associated with higher citation rates.},

of academic blogging as a vehicle for professional development. During this time I have been immersing myself
in the online environment and grappling to figure out what academic blogging means to me. To offer the reader a
rich insight into this experience I present a reflective account together with an analysis of these formative
experiences of social media. Higher Education (HE) in the Western world is currently grappling to position itself in
a shifting landscape of economic rationalisation, too-fast-to-keep-up technological innovation, and escalating
marketisation (OLTF 2011). Blended learning and social media are being explored as potential solutions to these
pressures. In this paper I explore the potential opportunities and challenges afforded by academic blogging for
professional development. The concepts I have used as a framework for discussion are: exposure, engagement
and networking. It is argued that these features combined with the non-hierarchical structure of social media
(Siemens and Weller 2011) mean that academic blogging has the potential to create a self-organising, highly
responsive and digitally reflexive staff, for a relatively low cost. However, not all academics or institutions will be
comfortable with the time investment or risk associated with writing in the public domain. However, if institutions
refuse to accept blogging as a form of scholarly activity then academics may struggle to position themselves as
public intellectuals in the digital age (Kirkup 2010).},

not yet produce metrics that can be used for more formal forms of research assessment at either
the individual level or at the levels of research groups and universities. We discuss the reasons for
this conclusion. We also propose to understand the development of these impact monitors by
analyzing the interaction between ‘technologies of narcissism’, ‘technologies of control’ and

scientific research papers.
Methods and Materials: Shortly after their publication in 2005, the quality and importance of a cohort of nearly 700
Wellcome Trust (WT) associated research papers were assessed by expert reviewers; each paper was reviewed by two WT
expert reviewers. After 3 years, we compared this initial assessment with other measures of paper impact.
Results: Shortly after publication, 62 (9\%) of the 687 research papers were determined to describe at least a ‘major addition
to knowledge’ –6 were thought to be ‘landmark’ papers. At an aggregate level, after 3 years, there was a strong positive
association between expert assessment and impact as measured by number of citations and F1000 rating. However, there
were some important exceptions indicating that bibliometric measures may not be sufficient in isolation as measures of
research quality and importance, and especially not for assessing single papers or small groups of research publications.
Conclusion: When attempting to assess the quality and importance of research papers, we found that sole reliance on
bibliometric indicators would have led us to miss papers containing important results as judged by expert review. In
particular, some papers that were highly rated by experts were not highly cited during the first three years after publication.
Tools that link expert peer reviews of research paper quality and importance to more quantitative indicators, such as
citation analysis would be valuable additions to the field of research assessment and evaluation.},

Second, we run regression and correlation tests to investigate the relationship between Twitter mentions, arXiv downloads, and article citations. We find that Twitter mentions and arXiv downloads of scholarly articles follow two distinct temporal patterns of activity, with Twitter mentions having shorter delays and narrower time spans than arXiv downloads. We also find that the volume of Twitter mentions is statistically correlated with arXiv downloads and early citations just months after the publication of a preprint, with a possible bias that favors highly mentioned articles.},

they provide a powerful tool for determining the degree of visibility and impact of web
resources. Among mention indicators, hypertextual links were a central part of many
studies until Yahoo! discontinued the ‘linkdomain’ command in 2011. Selective links
constitute a variant of external links where both the source and target of the link can be
selected. This paper intends to study the influence of social platforms (measured through
the number of selective external links) on academic environments, in order to ascertain
both the percentage that they constitute and whether some of them can be used as substitutes
of total external links. For this purpose, 141 URLs belonging to 76 Spanish universities
were compiled in 2010 (before Yahoo! stopped their link services), and the
number of links from 13 selected social platforms to these universities were calculated.
Results confirm a good correlation between total external links and links that come from
social platforms, with the exception of some applications (such as Digg and Technorati).
For those universities with a higher number of total external links, the high correlation is
only maintained on Delicious and Wikipedia, which can be utilized as substitutes of total
external links in the context analyzed. Notwithstanding, the global percentage of links from
social platforms constitute only a small fraction of total links, although a positive trend is
detected, especially in services such as Twitter, Youtube, and Facebook.},

Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic scientific evidence that altmetrics are valid proxies of either impact or utility although a few case studies have reported medium correlations between specific altmetrics and citation rates for individual journals or fields. To fill this gap, this study compares 11 altmetrics with Web of Science citations for 76 to 208,739 PubMed articles with at least one altmetric mention in each case and up to 1,891 journals per metric. It also introduces a simple sign test to overcome biases caused by different citation and usage windows. Statistically significant associations were found between higher metric scores and higher citations for articles with positive altmetric scores in all cases with sufficient evidence (Twitter, Facebook wall posts, research highlights, blogs, mainstream media and forums) except perhaps for Google+ posts. Evidence was insufficient for LinkedIn, Pinterest, question and answer sites, and Reddit, and no conclusions should be drawn about articles with zero altmetric scores or the strength of any correlation between altmetrics and citations. Nevertheless, comparisons between citations and metric values for articles published at different times, even within the same year, can remove or reverse this association and so publishers and scientometricians should consider the effect of time when using altmetrics to rank articles. Finally, the coverage of all the altmetrics except for Twitter seems to be low and so it is not clear if they are prevalent enough to be useful in practice.},

	abstract = {SignificanceA scientist will encounter many potential collaborators throughout his/her career. As such, the choice to start or terminate a collaboration can be an important strategic consideration with long-term implications. While previous studies have focused primarily on aggregate cross-sectional collaboration patterns, here we analyze the collaboration network from a researcher's local perspective along his/her career. Our longitudinal approach reveals that scientific collaboration is characterized by a high turnover rate juxtaposed with surprisingly frequent "life partners." We show that these extremely strong collaborations have a significant positive impact on productivity and citations--the apostle effect--representing the advantage of "super" social ties characterized by trust, conviction, and commitment. Scientists are frequently faced with the important decision to start or terminate a creative partnership. This process can be influenced by strategic motivations, as early career researchers are pursuers, whereas senior researchers are typically attractors, of new collaborative opportunities. Focusing on the longitudinal aspects of scientific collaboration, we analyzed 473 collaboration profiles using an egocentric perspective that accounts for researcher-specific characteristics and provides insight into a range of topics, from career achievement and sustainability to team dynamics and efficiency. From more than 166,000 collaboration records, we quantify the frequency distributions of collaboration duration and tie strength, showing that collaboration networks are dominated by weak ties characterized by high turnover rates. We use analytic extreme value thresholds to identify a new class of indispensable super ties, the strongest of which commonly exhibit {\textgreater}50\% publication overlap with the central scientist. The prevalence of super ties suggests that they arise from career strategies based upon cost, risk, and reward sharing and complementary skill matching. We then use a combination of descriptive and panel regression methods to compare the subset of publications coauthored with a super tie to the subset without one, controlling for pertinent features such as career age, prestige, team size, and prior group experience. We find that super ties contribute to above-average productivity and a 17\% citation increase per publication, thus identifying these partnerships--the analog of life partners--as a major factor in science career development.},

To this end, a detailed, large-scale citation analysis of patent-paper pairs in biotechnology is conducted. Those pairs signal the occurrence of research resulting simultaneously in scientific publications and patent applications. Patent-paper pairs are detected using text-mining algorithms applied on a large dataset. Starting from a dataset consisting of 948,432 scientific publications and 88,248 EPO and USPTO patent documents, 584 patent-paper pairs are identified. The forward citation patterns of these patent-paper pairs are then matched and compared to biotechnology publications without an equivalent patent. Publications linked to a patent receive more citations than publications without a patent link (after taking into account the necessary controls). In addition, by comparing H-indexes, our findings reveal that the authors involved in such pairs develop a larger scientific footprint than comparable colleagues refraining from patent activity. We conclude that involvement in patenting does not hamper the dissemination of published research in the field of biotechnology.},

For example, the national organization of the system of innovation has historically been important in determining competition. Reorganizations across industrial sectors and nation states, however, are induced by new technologies (biotechnology, ICT). The consequent transformations can be analyzed in terms of (neo-)evolutionary mechanisms.

Clearly, experts involved in domain studies would benefit from techniques that allow similarity to be detected-and hence facilitate mapping, categorization and classification efforts. In addition, given current debates on the relevance and appropriateness of academic patenting, the ability to assess content-relatedness between sets of documents-in this case, patents and publications-might become relevant and useful. We list several options available to arrive at content based similarity measures. Different options of a vector space model and latent semantic indexing approach have been selected and applied to the publications and patents of a sample of academic inventors (n = 6). We also validated the outcomes by using independently obtained validation scores of human raters. While we conclude that text mining techniques can be valuable for detecting similarities between patents and publications, our findings also indicate that the various options available to arrive at similarity measures vary considerably in terms of accuracy: some generally accepted text mining options, like dimensionality reduction and LSA, do not yield the best results when working with smaller document sets.

Sometimes author names are simply listed alphabetically. In other cases, authorship order is determined based on the contribution authors have made to a publication. Contribution- based authorship can facilitate proper credit assignment, for instance by giving most credits to the first author. In the case of alphabetical authorship, nothing can be inferred about the relative contribution made by the different authors of a publication. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of the use of alphabetical authorship in scientific publishing. Our analysis covers all fields of science. We find that the use of alphabetical authorship is declining over time. In 2011, the authors of less than 4\% of all publications intentionally chose to list their names alphabetically. The use of alphabetical authorship is most common in mathematics, economics (including finance), and high energy physics. Also, the use of alphabetical authorship is relatively more common in the case of publications with either a small or a large number of authors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The probability of choosing alphabetical name ordering rule is associated with high article quality, higher ranked institutions, smaller research team and the presence of European authors.},

The use of alphabetical authorship is common in the social sciences and humanities, mathematics, and in some physical disciplines. Chinese academic publication has increased rapidly in recent decades (Hong Kong and Macau were excluded from the study because Hong Kong and Macau are much more internationalized than mainland China). However, authors from mainland China do not prefer alphabetical authorship. The increase in publications from mainland China lowers the probability of intentional alphabetical authorship in the natural science and technology subject categories that we examined. In some natural science and technology categories, the influence is strong. But for the social sciences and humanities, the influence is weak, due to the lower share of world publications from mainland China. Yet, in some social science and humanities subject categories such as 'Economics', the relative share of publications from mainland China is increasing rapidly, and the results on alphabetical authorship trends will be felt in the near future.},

Thus, the presented study has been guided by three research questions that consider the influence of astrophysicists' activities (i.e., publishing and tweeting frequency) and of their tweet construction and affordance use (i.e. use of hashtags, language, and emotions) on the conversational connections they have on Twitter. We found that astrophysicists communicate with a variety of user types (e.g. colleagues, science communicators, other researchers, and educators) and that in the ego networks of the astrophysicists clear groups consisting of users with different professional roles can be distinguished. Interestingly, the analysis of noun phrases and hashtags showed that when the astrophysicists address the different groups of very different professional composition they use very similar terminology, but that they do not talk to each other (i.e. mentioning other user names in tweets). The results also showed that in those areas of the ego networks that tweeted more the sentiment of the tweets tended to be closer to neutral, connecting frequent tweeting with information sharing activities rather than conversations or expressing opinions.},

	doi = {10.1177/0306312715598666},
	abstract = {One of the most significant shifts in science policy of the past three decades is a concern with extending scientific practice to include a role for  society'. Recently, this has led to legislative calls for the integration of the social sciences and humanities in publicly funded research and development initiatives. In nanotechnology - integration's primary field site - this policy has institutionalized the practice of hiring social scientists in technical facilities. Increasingly mainstream, the workings and results of this integration mechanism remain understudied. In this article, I build upon my three-year experience as the in-house social scientist at the Cornell NanoScale Facility and the United States' National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network to engage empirically and conceptually with this mode of governance in nanotechnology. From the vantage point of the integrated social scientist, I argue that in its current enactment, integration emerges as a particular kind of care work, with social scientists being fashioned as the main caretakers. Examining integration as a type of care practice and as a  matter of care' allows me to highlight the often invisible, existential, epistemic, and affective costs of care as governance. Illuminating a framework where social scientists are called upon to observe but not disturb, to reify boundaries rather than blur them, this article serves as a word of caution against integration as a novel mode of governance that seemingly privileges situatedness, care, and entanglement, moving us toward an analytically skeptical (but not dismissive) perspective on integration.},

The project focuses on collaborative approaches to research and is set in the context of the changing dynamics and institutional bases of research. Its primary purpose is both to review and contribute to the evidence-base on institutional and individual researcher approaches to collaborative research with particular reference to the relationship between collaboration and mission in higher education institutions (HEIs). The research used three methods. First, it reviews literature on the current state of understanding about the concept, nature and driving forces behind collaboration. Second, through bibliometric analysis it provides a comprehensive account of the principal types and levels (ranging from interindividual through inter-institutional to inter- sectoral and international collaboration) of research activity. Third, from case study anlysis it examines how higher education institutions (HEIs) and individual researchers from a range of disciplinary fields approach research collaboration in both strategic and operational terms. The consultants carried out the study during the period November 1999 to March 2000.},

In essence, it seems likely that for subjects with a high percentage of co-authors in alphabetical order, a substantial fraction of the articles have been put in alphabetical order contrary to the contributions of the authors. Moreover, there is evidence that this will impact upon the career progression of those involved. Using data from the Social Sciences Citation Index this research compares the percentage of co- authors in alphabetical order in twenty social science subjects. This study’s core findings are: (a) the percentage of authors in alphabetical order shows disciplinary differences and is much higher in Economics than in Information Science, and (b) the Spearman correlation between having a high percentage of two authored articles in alphabetical order and a skewing of first authorship to the beginning of the alphabet is .81. An unexpected additional finding is that on average for the subjects with a random distribution of authorship (50\% of two-author articles in alphabetical order), first authorship is twenty present more common for author surnames beginning with A or b than for surnames beginning with U to Z.},

However, we know little about the different ways in which a study can be cited; in particular, are papers cited to point out their merits or their flaws? We elaborated a methodology to characterize “negative” citations using bibliometric data and natural language processing. We found that negative citations concerned higher-quality papers, were focused on a study’s findings rather than theories or methods, and originated from scholars who were closer to the authors of the focal paper in terms of discipline and social distance, but not geographically. Receiving a negative citation was also associated with a slightly faster decline in citations to the paper in the long run.},

	abstract = {An elite segment of the academic output gap between Denmark and Norway was examined using harmonic estimates of publication credit for contributions to Science and Nature in 2012 and 2013. Denmark still leads but the gap narrowed in 2013 as Norway's credit increased 58\%, while Denmark's credit increased only 5.4\%, even though Norway had 36\% fewer, and Denmark 40\% more, coauthor contributions than in 2012. Concurrently, the credit produced by the least productive half of the contributions rose tenfold from 0.9\% to 10.1\% for Norway, but dropped from 7.2\% to 5.7\% for Denmark. Overall, contributory inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient, fell from 0.78 to 0.51 for Norway, but rose from 0.63 to 0.68 for Denmark. Neither gap narrowing nor the positive association between reduced contributory inequality and increased credit were detected by conventional metrics. Conventional metrics are confounded by equalizing bias (EqB) which favours small contributors at the expense of large contributors, and which carries an element of reverse meritocracy and systemic injustice into bibliometric performance assessment. EqB was corrected by using all relevant byline information from every coauthored publication in the source data. This approach demonstrates the feasibility of using EqB-corrected publication credit in gap assessment at the national level.},

	abstract = {In this paper, I compare several readily observable measures of intellectual property rights between agricultural economics - a discipline that attaches considerable importance to author order - and economics - a discipline that attaches little, if any, importance to author order. Specifically, I examine: (1) the incidence of coauthorship - i.e., the likelihood that an individual coauthors with others, (2) the extent of coauthorship - i.e., the number of authors listed on each coauthored paper, (3) the number of individuals thanked for contributing to the research being reported and (4) alphabetization of authorship for papers published in three top journals in each scientific discipline. I find statistically significant differences across-the-board. These differences suggest that interdisciplinary differences with respect to the relative importance attached to contribution affect the allocation of intellectual property rights in science. These findings are compelling because they demonstrate that the allocation of intellectual property rights and how the production of science is structured are related. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this respect, the existing accounts do not show that intentions can be shared in any literal sense. This article argues that, in failing to show how intentions can be literally shared, these accounts fail to resolve what seems problematic in the notion of shared intention. It then offers an account in which the problem of shared intention is resolved, because intention can indeed be literally shared. This account is derived from Margaret Gilbert's notion of a "pool of wills," to which it applies Searle's definition of intention. CR - Copyright © 1997 International Phenomenological Society},

	abstract = {BackgroundThe ability of a scientist to maintain a continuous stream of publication may be important, because research requires continuity of effort. However, there is no data on what proportion of scientists manages to publish each and every year over long periods of time.Methodology/Principal FindingsUsing the entire Scopus database, we estimated that there are 15,153,100 publishing scientists (distinct author identifiers) in the period 1996–2011. However, only 150,608 ({\textless}1\%) of them have published something in each and every year in this 16-year period (uninterrupted, continuous presence [UCP] in the literature). This small core of scientists with UCP are far more cited than others, and they account for 41.7\% of all papers in the same period and 87.1\% of all papers with {\textgreater}1000 citations in the same period. Skipping even a single year substantially affected the average citation impact. We also studied the birth and death dynamics of membership in this influential UCP core, by imputing and estimating UCP-births and UCP-deaths. We estimated that 16,877 scientists would qualify for UCP-birth in 1997 (no publication in 1996, UCP in 1997–2012) and 9,673 scientists had their UCP-death in 2010. The relative representation of authors with UCP was enriched in Medical Research, in the academic sector and in Europe/North America, while the relative representation of authors without UCP was enriched in the Social Sciences and Humanities, in industry, and in other continents.ConclusionsThe proportion of the scientific workforce that maintains a continuous uninterrupted stream of publications each and every year over many years is very limited, but it accounts for the lion’s share of researchers with high citation impact. This finding may have implications for the structure, stability and vulnerability of the scientific workforce.},

Our rubber stamps and bureaucratic forms, our endless regulations, and the negative connotation of high fines, lost books, and limited reserve loans, do not exactly lend the department an air of approachability. In an age when academic libraries are facing meager budgets and declining usage statistics, this tired foot soldier may have a new purpose. This department, mainly staffed by sleepy, hungry, and overburdened students, can become the gateway to a welcoming world of information. This force of willing student assistants can be mobilized for the library's advantage.

Findings -- It is argued that fines are a necessary aspect of efficient library operations and to ensure collective responsibility for the collections among members. However the paper queries the reliance of some libraries on the income generated by fines, and questions whether this reliance is in opposition to the role of the library in encouraging efficient use of the stock. Practical implications -- The paper considers the positives and negatives of a fines culture, and may be useful background for those pondering the topic. Originality/value -- The paper discusses a topic that is of current professional debate as to its efficacy and should of value for those interested in the arguments for and against fines in libraries, and their impact on library usage.

This policy reflects a traditional take on fines as a measure designed to encourage prompt returns and prevent loss of materials, but not every library shares this goal.

Not only is it validating to see the smiles on the faces of young children who are just beginning to experience the excitement of using a library card, it is also reassuring, in an era of virtual reality, to see real live people who still depend upon the library for information, education, and recreation. However, working at the circulation desk also has a downside: the dreaded reality of overdue fines. Every job has its downside, and fines are the bane of any circulation clerk's existence. Over time, some circulation clerks begin to suffer from the occupational hazard of cynicism. They become hardened toward chronic overdue borrowers and openly dismiss their excuses for overdue items and lost and damaged materials. The result is that an adversarial relationship between staff and patrons with overdue items can develop. Adapted from the source document.},

	abstract = {Every U.S. state and the District of Columbia has a law on the books that protects a library borrower's privacy, both an ethical and legal obligation of the library. In addition, FERPA further restricts access to users' records. Getting the message across to staff can be a challenge, especially if you employ students or volunteers who may not share your strongly held sense of professional responsibility or nuanced appreciation. Using scenarios, or minicase studies, based on real-life experiences to generate discussion and expand the scope of their understanding can be a very effective way to transmit the message. This article outlines the method used at Penn State University Libraries to instruct frontline staff on policy, law, and the ethics of protecting the confidentiality and privacy of library users. Pedagogy of case study is discussed. Advice on designing a training session and examples are provided. Adapted from the source document.},

However, in order to maintain the service quality, 'emotional labor' is usually performed by the librarians when encounter aggressive patrons. Emotional labor is the manipulation of the required emotional expression, and the strategies used to maintain the service quality. To understand circulation librarians' service strategies coping with aggressive patrons from the perspective of emotional labor, semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted in this study. The interviewees consisted of 15 university circulation librarians all over Taiwan. The findings revealed that the factors which may elicit aggressive reaction included library services and the patrons' personal traits. And to cope with the aggressive patrons, the circulation librarians should employ self-controlling, surface acting, and other service strategies such as persuasion or active listening.

	doi = {10.1136/jme.2008.024299},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To compare 2005 and 1995 ethics guidelines from journal editors to authors regarding requirements for institutional review board (IRB) approval and conflict-of-interest (COI) disclosure.

DESIGN: A descriptive study of the ethics guidelines published in 103 English-language biomedical journals listed in the Abridged Index Medicus in 1995 and 2005. Each journal was reviewed by the principal author and one of four independent reviewers.

RESULTS: During the period, the proportion of journals requiring IRB approval increased from 42\% (95\% CI 32.2\% to 51.2\%, p{\textless}0.001) to 76\% (95\% CI 66.4\% to 83.1\%, p{\textless}0.001). In 2005, an additional 9\% referred to the Declaration of Helsinki or the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors' Uniform requirements for ethical guidelines; 15\% (95\% CI 8.5\% to 22.5\%, p{\textless}0.01) provided ambiguous or no requirements. The proportion of journals requiring COI disclosure increased from 75\% (95\% CI 66.6\% to 83.3\%, p{\textless}0.05) to 94\% (95\% CI 89.4\% to 98.6\%, p{\textless}0.05); 41\% had comprehensive requirements, while some addressed only funding source (6\%), were vague (10\%) or both (14\%). Criteria for authorship rose from 40\% (95\% CI 30.5\% to 49.5\%, p{\textless}0.05) to 72\% (95\% CI 63.3\% to 80.7\%, p{\textless}0.05). Journals with higher impact factors were more likely to require IRB approval (p{\textless}0.01). Journals in anaesthesia and radiology all required IRB approval; requirements in other disciplines varied.

CONCLUSIONS: Instructions to authors regarding ethical standards have improved. Some remain incomplete, especially regarding the scope of disclosure of COI. The ethical guidelines presented to authors need further clarification and standardisation.},

Nevertheless, the President's Commission on the Patent System has proposed that patent rights be awarded on a first-to-file basis, and this recommendation is now embodied in bills before Congress. The author urges that the conclusion that a pure first-to-file system would be better for the United States should not be too hastily drawn. He reveals that the present United States patent system is neither purely a first-to-invent nor first-to-file system, but a hybrid system containing many features of both that gives a great advantage to the first person to file a patent application while also retaining important aspects of a first-to-invent system.

Within such a programme both scientific facts and technological artefacts are to be understood as social constructs. Literature on the sociology of science, the science-technology relationship, and technology studies is reviewed. The empirical programme of relativism within the sociology of scientific knowledge and a recent study of the social construction of technological artefacts are combined to produce the new approach. The concepts of 'interpretative flexibility' and 'closure mechanism', and the notion of 'social group' are developed and illustrated by reference to a study of solar physics and a study of the development of the bicycle.

Using data obtained from printed sources and questionnaires mailed to university physicists, the conditions making for high visibility of a scientist's work are studied. Four strong determinants of visibility were found: the quality of work, as measured by citations; the honorific awards received for work in physics; the prestige of the physics department to which the scientist belongs; and specialty. Quantity of output, age, and name-ordering patterns on collaborative papers have no independent effect on visibility. Just as some physicists may be easily seen (i.e., have high visibility), others are in positions where they may easily see. This latter characteristic is called "awareness." The data indicate that awareness is high in all sectors of the population studied. Variables such as age, rank of department, and quality of work made for only minor differences in awareness. We conclude that the communication system in physics operates efficiently. CR - Copyright © 1968 American Sociological Association},

The result of this common procedure has been an anachronistic solidification of disciplinary lines among rhetoric, philosophy, and poetics. An equally relevant effect has been the polarization of the practices of imitation and those concerned with invention. This paper seeks to elaborate a different taxonomy with which to approach imitation, one that focuses primarily on the encounter between subjects and objects in the actual practice of imitation. By attending to the complex relations of repetition and variation across disciplinary lines, this new taxonomy offers insight into the often overlooked connections between imitation and invention in the intersecting realms of rhetoric, philosophy, and poetics.

A crucial conceptual starting point for the study was Michel Foucault’s work on the discursive construction of power/knowledge. The study represents one attempt to develop a discourse analytic approach to the study of information behavior. The researcher carried out semistructured qualitative interviews, based in part on Dervin’s “Life‐Line” and “Time‐Line” techniques, with fifteen information behavior researchers from eight universities in five countries in Europe and North America. The study’s findings provide a case study in how discourse operates at the microsociological level. It provides examples of how community members engage with, accept, and contest both new and established “truth statements” and discursive practices. They demonstrate that both participants’ formal and informal information behaviors are the product of discursive power/knowledge relations. CR - Copyright © 2007 The University of Chicago Press},

	abstract = {How do we come to trust our knowledge of the world? What are the means by which we distinguish true from false accounts? Why do we credit one observational statement over another? In A Social History of Truth, a leading scholar addresses these universal questions through an elegant recreation of a crucial period in the history of early modern science: the social world of gentlemen-philosophers in seventeenth-century England. Steven Shapin paints a vivid picture of the relations between gentlemanly culture and scientific practice. He argues that problems of credibility in science were solved through the codes and conventions of genteel conduct: trust, civility, honor, and integrity. These codes formed, and arguably still form, an important basis for securing reliable knowledge about the natural world. Shapin explains how gentlemen-philosophers resolved varying testimony about such phemonema as comets, icebergs, and the pressure of water by bringing to bear practical social knowledge and standards of decorum. For instance, while "vulgar" divers reported they experienced no crushing pressure no matter how deep into the sea they dived, gentlemen-philosophers preferred the evidence of crushed pewter bottles. Shapin uses richly detailed historical narrative to make a powerful argument about the establishment of factual knowledge both in science and in everyday practice. Accounts of the mores and manners of gentlemen-philosophers illustrate Shapin's broad claim that trust is imperative for constituting every kind of knowledge. Knowledge-making is always a collective enterprise: people have to know whom to trust in order to know something about the natural world. A Social History of Truth is a bold theoretical and historical exploration of the social conditions that make knowledge possible in any period and in any endeavor.},

After distinguishing this question from another, regarding individuation, with which it is often confused, this paper offers an argument that authorship is indeed a necessary feature of most artworks. The argument proceeds from ‘independence principles’, which govern the processes by which artworks are produced. Independence principles are motivated, in turn, by metaphysical reflections on what it takes to prevent an artist from producing a particular work of art.},

	abstract = {In this paper, I discuss the many contributions of a versatile black technician, Vivien Thomas, to surgical animal research between 1930 and 1979 at Vanderbilt University and Johns Hopkins University. Thomas' experimental work led to a surgical solution for a life-threatening heart defect, called tetralogy of Fallot. Children with this condition lack sufficient oxygenation and were referred to as 'blue babies'. Following Thomas' research trajectory and his relationship with surgeon Dr Alfred Blalock, I review the conditions under which differing expectations towards race and occupation clashed, creating a status dilemma for Thomas. While the torsion originated in the laboratory where technical skills are valued, the research locale also facilitated a temporary, fragile solution for the status dilemma, because it separated Thomas from public view. Yet, Thomas' dexterity as a laboratory researcher enhanced his dilemma, because credit kept eluding him. In order to track the dynamics of race and occupational subordination as lived experience in the laboratory, I argue for an analysis of the process of crediting people for their scientific accomplishments.

The Popperian ontology then has to be extended to admit the concept of information and its relation to subjective and objective know ledge. The spaces of Popper's three worlds are then con sidered. It is argued that cognitive and physical spaces are not identical and that this lack of identity creates problems for the proper quantification of information phenomena.},

	volume = {12},
	url = {http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0737678295000585},
	doi = {10.1016/0737-6782(95)00058-5},
	abstract = {For those of us trying to understand the nature of innovation, the role of the scientist or engineer presents a conundrum. Such individuals are often sources of innovation in both products and processes, yet routine science and engineering is typically carried out in an environment that stresses structure, order, and adherence to prescribed methods—exactly the wrong setting for successful innovation. To help explain the diminishing role of science and the burgeoning role of individuals in innovation, Carol J. Steiner presents a philosophy of innovation. Suggesting that unconventional individuals, rather than conventional science or engineering, are central to innovation success, this philosophy of innovation is derived from a philosophy of human nature formulated by Martin Heidegger. Heidegger identified three elements of human nature: (1) it is human nature to be practically involved in a complex world rather than rationally involved with a conceptually simplified world; (2) it is human nature to be authentic (i.e., unconventional, uncommitted to one's paradigm) at least some of the time; and (3) it is human nature to be cooperative. In other words, the methods and organizational structures that characterize “good” science are in direct conflict with human nature. By examining things in isolation from their natural linkages, the scientist misses the holistic view—the big picture—necessary for successful innovation. Central to this philosophy of innovation is individuality understood as authenticity. The term authenticity refers to both an unconventional (i.e., unscientific) approach to the world and an openness to alternative viewpoints. This openness is the basis for cooperative rather than competitive interaction. The fundamental themes of this philosophy of innovation are the importance of individual experience, the importance of unconventional (free) interpretations, and the importance of respect for individual uniqueness. The magic moments of innovation arise when scientists or engineers assert their individuality, break free from the structured thinking of their traditional methods, and synthesize novel interpretations that move their projects in new directions. This philosophy of innovation is not presented as a means for determining why innovation succeeds or fails. Instead, it provides a framework for assessing organizational or personal approaches to innovation. In other words, it gives managers a means for understanding and interpreting the human elements of particular innovation projects.},

Allen, we contribute to the emerging microlevel theory of knowledge recombination by examining how individual-level characteristics of inventors affect the breadth of their technological recombinations. Our data set combines information from 30,550 European patents with matched survey data obtained from 1,880 inventors. The analysis supports the view that inventors with a scientific education are more likely to generate patents that span technological boundaries (in our case, 30 broad, top-level technological domains) than inventors with an engineering degree. A doctoral degree is associated with increased recombination breadth for all groups of inventors. The breadth of an inventor's technological recombinations diminishes with increasing temporal distance to his education, but the differences between scientists and engineers persist over time. Our findings provide several new insights for research on inventors, the literature on organizational learning and innovation, and strategy research. CR - Copyright © 2013 INFORMS},

	abstract = {In a large and detailed survey of scientific coauthorship in pathology, 3500 members of the US and Canadian Academy of Pathology (USCAP) were surveyed via the Internet with a final response rate of 22.5\%. The results were compared with a previous survey of members of the American Physical Society (APS). The fields are found to be very similar. For example, there is no well-defined way to determine coauthorship: the byline is arrived at without the use of public coauthorship standards according to 90\% of respondents (92\% in physics). A substantial amount of inappropriate authorship is present in both fields using a variety of authorship guidelines. For example, using the guideline of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (the "Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals" [ICMJE]), the average number of coauthors judged to be inappropriate in pathology on papers with 4 coauthors is 1.0 (1.2 in physics), and using the guideline requiring "direct contributions to scientific discovery or invention," we find 1.6 (1.5 in physics). Finally, it is suggested that authorship guidelines should be constructed by public surveys rather than closed-door committees: an authorship guideline constructed from previous survey feedback (from APS members) was found to be preferable to USCAP members (it received 40\% of the vote, the ICMJE received 24\% of the vote).},

	abstract = {Bibliometricians face several issues when drawing and analyzing samples of citation records for their research. Drawing samples that are too small may make it difficult or impossible for studies to achieve their goals, while drawing samples that are too large may drain resources that could be better used for other purposes. This paper considers three common situations and offers advice for dealing with each. First, an entire population of records is available for an institution. We argue that, even though all records have been collected, the use of inferential statistics and significance testing is both common and desirable. Second, because of limited resources or other factors, a sample of records needs to be drawn. We demonstrate how power analyses can be used to determine in advance how large the sample needs to be to achieve the study's goals. Third, the sample size may already be determined, either because the data have already been collected or because resources are limited. We show how power analyses can again be used to determine how large effects need to be in order to find effects that are statistically significant. Such information can then help researchers to develop reasonable expectations as to what their analysis can accomplish. While we focus on issues of interest to bibliometricians, our recommendations and procedures can easily be adapted for other fields of study.},

	abstract = {Publicly funded research involves the distribution of a considerable amount of money. Funding agencies such as the US National Science Foundation (NSF), the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the European Research Council (ERC) give billions of dollars or euros of taxpayers' money to individual researchers, research teams, universities, and research institutes each year. Taxpayers accordingly expect that governments and funding agencies will spend their money prudently and efficiently. Investing money to the greatest effect is not a challenge unique to research funding agencies and there are many strategies and schemes to choose from. Nevertheless, most funders rely on a tried and tested method in line with the tradition of the scientific community: the peer review of individual proposals to identify the most promising projects for funding. This method has been considered the gold standard for assessing the scientific value of research projects essentially since the end of the Second World War. {\textgreater} Investing money to the greatest effect is not a challenge unique to research funding agencies and there are many strategies and schemes to choose from However, there is mounting critique of the use of peer review to direct research funding. High on the list of complaints is the cost, both in terms of time and money. In 2012, for example, NSF convened more than 17,000 scientists to review 53,556 proposals [1]. Reviewers generally spend a considerable time and effort to assess and rate proposals of which only a minority can eventually get funded. Of course, such a high rejection rate is also frustrating for the applicants. Scientists spend an increasing amount of time writing and submitting grant proposals.

Addressing such questions means looking at science from a dynamic systems perspective.

This article uses bibliometric data to examine the extent and nature of changes identified by these authors, taking as an example British research. We use their theoretical frameworks to investigate five characteristics of research said to be increasingly pervasive--namely, application, interdisciplinarity, networking, internationalization, and concentration of resources. Results indicate that research may be becoming more interdisciplinary and that research is increasingly conducted more in networks, both domestic and international; but the data are more ambiguous regarding application and concentration.},

These problems are hypothesized to be worsened by lack of consensus on theories and methods, by selective publication processes, and by career systems too heavily oriented toward productivity, such as those adopted in the United States (US). Here, we extracted 1,174 primary outcomes appearing in 82 meta-analyses published in health-related biological and behavioral research sampled from the Web of Science categories Genetics \& Heredity and Psychiatry and measured how individual results deviated from the overall summary effect size within their respective meta-analysis. We found that primary studies whose outcome included behavioral parameters were generally more likely to report extreme effects, and those with a corresponding author based in the US were more likely to deviate in the direction predicted by their experimental hypotheses, particularly when their outcome did not include additional biological parameters. Nonbehavioral studies showed no such "US effect" and were subject mainly to sampling variance and small-study effects, which were stronger for non-US countries. Although this latter finding could be interpreted as a publication bias against non-US authors, the US effect observed in behavioral research is unlikely to be generated by editorial biases. Behavioral studies have lower methodological consensus and higher noise, making US researchers potentially more likely to express an underlying propensity to report strong and significant findings.},

	url = {http://books.google.ca/books/about/Spreadable_Media.html?id=pq1oClUrhDgC&pgis=1},
	abstract = {Spreadable Media maps fundamental changes taking place in our contemporary media environment, a space where corporations no longer tightly control media distribution and many of us are directly involved in the circulation of content. It contrasts “stickiness”—aggregating attention in centralized places—with “spreadability”—dispersing content widely through both formal and informal networks,some approved, many unauthorized. Stickiness has been the measure of success in the broadcast era (and has been carried over to the online world), but “spreadability” describes the ways content travels through social media. Following up on the hugely influential Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide, this book challenges some of the prevailing metaphors and frameworks used to describe contemporary media, from biological metaphors like “memes” and “viral” to the concept of “Web 2.0” and the popular notion of “influencers.” Spreadable Media examines the nature of audience engagement,the environment of participation, the way appraisal creates value,and the transnational flows at the heart of these phenomena. It delineates the elements that make content more spreadable and highlights emerging media business models built for a world of participatory circulation. The book also explores the internal tensions companies face as they adapt to the new communication reality and argues for the need to shift from “hearing” to “listening” in corporate culture. Drawing on examples from film, music, games, comics, television,transmedia storytelling, advertising, and public relations industries,among others—from both the U.S. and around the world—the authors illustrate the contours of our current media environment.They highlight the vexing questions content creators must tackle and the responsibilities we all face as citizens in a world where many of us regularly circulate media content. Written for any and all of us who actively create and share media content, Spreadable Media provides a clear understanding of how people are spreading ideas and the implications these activities have for business, politics, and everyday life.},

	abstract = {(Publisher-supplied data) Elaine Fox is Professor of Psychology at the University of Essex. She lectured at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, and University College Dublin before taking up her current role in 1994. She was Associate Editor of Cognition and Emotion from 1996 until 2001 and is carrying out research at the Medical Research Council's Cognition and Brain Science's Unit in Cambridge. (Publisher-supplied data) Emotions and affective processes are fundamentally important to our lives. They regulate our relationships and social interactions, they help us communicate with one another, and almost certainly help us maintain good health and prevent the onset and development of disease. The study of emotion has a long history in philosophy and psychology. However, until recently, emotion research has been a marginal activity in psychological science. In the behaviorist era, which dominated much of the twentieth century, emotion was often deemed unworthy of serious research because the field lacked objective ways to measure emotions and their associated feelings without resorting to introspection by subjects, which is, by definition, non-behavioral. In addition, since Plato, it is easy to discern a quiet bias in the sciences against emotions or "passions," which were often posited as inferior to the higher gifts of Reason and unworthy of serious research. This view, however, has changed radically in the past few years. With the development of sophisticated imaging tools like fMRI, researchers have uncovered the centrality of emotion to our thinking and reasoning and remembering, and evidence has demonstrated that it may be misleading to posit two separate phenomena altogether, i.e., "cognition" and "emotion." These traditional categories have been shown to be highly interdependent processes that interact with each other in a dynamic way. Our memories of the past; our decisions and plans for the future; what we attend to on a moment-to-moment basis; what we think about as we daydream: all of those cognitive operations are coloured by emotions, just as emotions themselves are influenced by cognitive processes. Therefore, in order to gain a more complete understanding of the richness of our mental life we need to more fully understand the role of emotions and how these processes interact with the traditionally defined "cognitive" processes. The Science of Emotion is the first textbook to integrate psychology and neuroscientific evidence to develop a modern understanding of emotion and the nature of the links between processes that have traditionally been considered "cognitive" and those that have traditionally been considered "emotional." While these two constructs have often been treated as separate, residing in two separate areas of the brain-the neo-cortex and the limbic system, respectively, The Science of Emotion uses the latest research to show how the two phenomena are intertwined and interdependent both at neural and psychological levels. The book contains at least one focus box per chapter that will either take an interesting question (e.g., Do we run because we are afraid, or afraid because we run?) or a more empirically-based question from everyday life (e.g., Are we more likely to remember emotional events?). There is also a further material website with links and more detailed descriptions of key experiments.},

He takes us into the secret world of Survivor Spoilers, where avid internet users pool their knowledge to unearth the show’s secrets before they are revealed on the air. He introduces us to young Harry Potter fans who are writing their own Hogwarts tales while executives at Warner Brothers struggle for control of their franchise. He shows us how The Matrix has pushed transmedia storytelling to new levels, creating a fictional world where consumers track down bits of the story across multiple media channels.Jenkins argues that struggles over convergence will redefine the face of American popular culture. Industry leaders see opportunities to direct content across many channels to increase revenue and broaden markets. At the same time, consumers envision a liberated public sphere, free of network controls, in a decentralized media environment. Sometimes corporate and grassroots efforts reinforce each other, creating closer, more rewarding relations between media producers and consumers. Sometimes these two forces are at war.Jenkins provides a riveting introduction to the world where every story gets told and every brand gets sold across multiple media platforms. He explains the cultural shift that is occurring as consumers fight for control across disparate channels, changing the way we do business, elect our leaders, and educate our children.},

	doi = {10.1007/s11948-011-9344-5},
	abstract = {The commercialization of academic science has come to be understood as economically desirable for institutions, individual researchers, and the public. Not surprisingly, commercial activity, particularly that which results from patenting, appears to be producing changes in the standards used to evaluate scientists' performance and contributions. In this context, concerns about a gender gap in patenting activity have arisen and some have argued for the need to encourage women to seek more patents. They believe that because academic advancement is mainly dependent on productivity (Stuart and Ding in American Journal of Sociology 112:97-144, 2006; Azoulay et al. in Journal of Economic Behavior \& Organization 63:599-623, 2007), differences in research output have the power to negatively impact women's careers. Moreover, in the case of patenting activity, they claim that the gender gap also has the potential to negatively affect society. This is so because scientific and technological advancement and innovation play a crucial role in contemporary societies. Thus, women's more limited involvement in the commercialization of science and technology can also be detrimental to innovation itself. Nevertheless, calls to encourage women to patent on grounds that such activity is likely to play a significant role in the betterment of both women's careers and society seem to be based on two problematic assumptions: (1) that the methods to determine women's productivity in patenting activities are an appropriate way to measure their research efforts and the impact of their work, and (2) that patenting, particularly in academia, benefits society. The purpose of this paper is to call into question these two assumptions.},

This article uses concepts from Amartya Sen's work on inequality to frame gender issues in science and technology policy. Programs that focus on increasing the number of women in science and engineering careers have not generally addressed a broader set of circumstances that intersect with gender at various economic levels and stages of life. The agendas in research and innovation policies also need to reflect these issues, and fair allocation of resources within both science and technology needs to be on the agenda. Getting women into high-level positions is not enough. Articulating the full research and innovation agendas for women will require broader participatory processes.},

The Congressional Joint Economic Committee, among other authorities, argued that the increase in university patenting and licensing contributed to the economic boom of the 1990s. Many observers have attributed this trend to the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, which facilitated patenting and licensing by universities. This book examines the conventional wisdom by adopting a more holistic point of view, examining the diverse channels within which commercialization has occurred throughout the 20th century and since the passage of the Act. Using quantitative analysis and detailed case studies to assess the effects of the Act, the authors conclude that universities must maintain their historic commitment to the free flow of knowledge to serve the global public interest and sustain their remarkable scientific and technological achievements of the past century."--BOOK JACKET.},

Behavior such as data fabrication or plagiarism are (almost) unanimously rejected and admitted by less than 4\% of participants. Research practices that are often considered “questionable,” e.g., strategic behavior while analyzing results or in the publication process, are rejected by at least 60\%. Despite their low justifiability, these behaviors are widespread. Ninety-four percent report having engaged in at least one unaccepted research practice. Surveyed economists perceive strong pressure to publish. The level of justifiability assigned to different misdemeanors does not increase with the perception of pressure. However, perceived pressure is found to be positively related to the admission of being involved in several unaccepted research practices. Although the results cannot prove causality, they are consistent with the notion that the “publish or perish” culture motivates researchers to violate research norms.},

Position in the field indicates the potential for a force exerted on the person, but a force that impinges “from the inside” as opposed to external compulsion. Motivation is accordingly considered to be the paramount example of social structure in action, as opposed to a residue of chance or freedom. While field theory is often castigated for its necessarily tautological definition, this may be far more of an advantage than a defect. Field theory offers social scientists a combination of analytical insight and attention to the concrete; further, the implicit definition of “explanation” that it brings is one that, unlike conventional sociological definitions, is internally consistent and in accord with everyday usage.

In trying to describe contemporary society, we cannot neglect the social implication of the web. Our assumption is that the evolution of the Internet has led to problematic effects on the relevance of concepts such as individuality, author, authorship and copyright, as commonly used up till now. The first part of the article focuses on individuality as a means to describe individual actors and social structures in the first modernity, paying particular attention to the idea of the author as an individual in the field of intellectual products. New communication forms online make the connection between the individuality of the author and the text weaker and less recognizable. The second part develops the theme of scientific knowledge in contemporary society, with regard to scholarly authorship. The Internet has produced deep transformations in scholarly publications. Technical and structural characteristics of the Internet suggest possibilities for a reorganization of the scientific system towards the replacement of authorship and reputation with innovative mechanisms of information processing and selection.

	abstract = {Background The number of coauthors in the medical literature has increased over the past 50 years as authorship continues to have important academic, social and financial implications. Aim and method The study aim was to determine the prevalence of honorary authorship in biomedical publications and identify the factors that lead to its existence. An email with a survey link was sent anonymously to 9283 corresponding authors of PubMed articles published within 1 year of contact. Results A completed survey was obtained from 1246 corresponding authors, a response rate of 15.75\%. One-third (33.4\%) admitted that they had added authors who did not deserve authorship credit. Origin of the study from Europe and Asia (p ≤ 0.001 and 0.005, respectively), study type as case report/case series (p=0.036) and increasing number of coauthors were found to be the associated factors on multivariate analysis. Journal impact factor was also found to be associated with honorary authorship (mean journal impact factor was 4.82 (SD 6.32) for those who self-reported honorary authorship and 5.60 (SD 7.13) for those who did not report unjust authorship, p=0.05). In retrospect, 75\% of the authors indicated that they would remove unjustified names from the authorship list. Reasons for adding honorary authors were complimentary (39.4\%), to avoid conflict at work (16.1\%), to facilitate article acceptance (7.2\%), and other (3.6\%). Conclusions Honorary authorship is relatively common in biomedical publications. Researchers should comply with the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors' criteria for authorship.

	abstract = {Publications are primarily a means of communicating scientific information to colleagues, but they are much more than that. Publications in peer reviewed journals are proof of academic competence, are used as a crucial component in evaluation criteria for academic promotion and fundraising and increase the prestige of research centres and universities. The urgent need for publications has also led to abuses in authorship. In the past the single-author article was the rule, but over the past decades, the average number of authors on scientific manuscripts has drastically increased. In the field of bioethics, however, no research has been undertaken to study whether the percentage of single-author articles is decreasing, the proportion of multi-author articles is increasing or the average number of authors per article is increasing. The objective of this research is to analyze these trends in authorship for the period 1990-2003 in peer reviewed journals in the field of bioethics. In the nine peer reviewed journals from the field of bioethics we studied, we observed a significant increase of the multi-author article and of the average number of authors. This is mainly due to the increase in the number of publications with an empirical design. This growing trend is a challenge for the editors of journals in the field of bioethics to enhance awareness about the value and definition of authorship. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the process by which radically novel technologies – ones such as radar, the turbojet, or the polymerase chain reaction – come into being. It shows that this process – “invention” – has a certain logical structure common to all cases. Invention is a process of linking some purpose or need with an effect that can be exploited to satisfy it. It may begin with a purpose or need for which existing methods are not satisfactory; this forces the seeking of a new principle (the idea of an effect in action). Or it may begin with a phenomenon or effect itself – usually a freshly discovered one – for which some associated principle of use suggests itself. Either way, translating this base principle into physical reality requires the creation of suitable working parts and supporting technologies. These raise their own challenges or problems, the solution of which may raise further challenges. As a result, invention is a recursive process: it repeats until each challenge or problem (and subproblem, and sub-subproblem) resolves itself into one that can be physically dealt with. It is challenging, usually lengthy, part-conceptual, and part-experimental.},

	abstract = {On the basis of readings of the works of literary and dramatic criticism within the Kierkegaardian authorship, I argue that authorship is, in the Kierkegaardian practice, best understood as akin to theatrical performance, at least insofar as such performance is theorized in the Kierkegaardian dramatic criticism. While the literary critical authors consistently demand of authors and written works that they cohere intelligibly around an ethical life-view--and thus, ultimately, that they set forth an unified authorial perspective--the works of the Kierkegaardian authorship itself are not of this sort at all. A duplicity and multiplicity of authorial perspectives is characteristic, not only of Kierkegaard's criticism, but of the Kierkegaardian authorship as a whole. The attempt to resolve that authorial abundance is, I argue, an attempt to deny the essence of the peculiar structures of authorship in the Kierkegaardian works. Rather, if there is to be any unity at all in the disparate works of the Kierkegaardian authorship, it will have to come from outside of the particular authorial perspectives at work within the authorship. I locate this unifying perspective, not in Søren Kierkegaard himself, but in an anonymous and unknowable "author of the authors," implied by the Kierkegaardian authors (including Kierkegaard) as themselves works of literary invention. In something of an analogy to the role played for Kant by the thing-in-itself, I argue that the author of the authors--what I call "the Kierkegaardian author"--must be posited behind the authors at work in the Kierkegaardian authorship, but cannot ever be known by the readers of that authorship. Each of the authorial perspectives within the authorship is performed by the Kierkegaardian author, but none of them is reducible to the Kierkegaardian author, such that we are left, as readers, with the daunting task of making sense of the authorship and its constitutive works and authors for ourselves--without reference to the Kierkegaardian author, except insofar as that author is the ground necessary for an understanding of Kierkegaard and the Kierkegaardian authors as themselves authored.},

Disciplines can be characterized by different styles of collaboration.  A significant portion of social science researchers list authorship in alphabetic order.  Conclusions.  Social science research relies heavily on collaborative activities. Patterns of credited authorship seem influenced by a discipline's norms as well as its research methodology.

Contributions to authorship cannot be validly quantified, and the relative merits of different publications are also neither equal nor validly quantifiable.

	abstract = {The current use of citation-based metrics to evaluate the research output of individual researchers is highly discriminatory because they are uniformly applied to authors of single-author articles as well as contributors of multi-author papers. In the latter case, these quantitative measures are counted, as if each contributor were the single author of the full article. In this way, each and every contributor is assigned the full impact-factor score and all the citations that the article has received. This has a multiplication effect on each contributor's citation-based evaluative metrics of multi-author articles, because the more contributors an article has, the more undeserved credit is assigned to each of them. In this paper, I argue that this unfair system could be made fairer by requesting the contributors of multi-author articles to describe the nature of their contribution, and to assign a numerical value to their degree of relative contribution. In this way, we could create a contribution-specific index of each contributor for each citation metric. This would be a strong disincentive against honorary authorship and publication cartels, because it would transform the current win-win strategy of accepting honorary authors in the byline into a zero-sum game for each contributor.

This paper investigates the authorship policies of bioethics journals to determine whether they provide adequate guidance for researchers who submit articles for publication, which can help deter inappropriate authorship. It was found that 63.3\% of bioethics journals provide no guidance on authorship; 36.7\% provide guidance on which contributions merit authorship, 23.3\% provide guidance on which contributions do not merit authorship, 23.3\% require authors to take responsibility for their contributions or for the article as a whole, 20\% provide guidance on which contributions merit an acknowledgement but not authorship, 6.7\% require authors to describe their contributions, and only 3.3\% distinguish between authorship in empirical and conceptual research. To provide authors with effective guidance and promote integrity in bioethics research, bioethics journals should adopt authorship policies that address several important topics, such as the qualifications for authorship, describing authorship contributions, taking responsibility for the research and the difference between authorship in empirical and conceptual research.

	abstract = {"Learning from Strangers is the definitive work on qualitative research interviewing. It draws on Robert Weiss's thirty years of experience interviewing and teaching others how to do it. Through those years, Dr. Weiss has shown consummate skill at eliciting insightful, deeply felt responses when interviewing for his successful books on such diverse topics as doing well at work, coping with marital separation, and loneliness. The most effective interviews, says Weiss, rely on creating cooperation - an open and trusting alliance between interviewer and respondent, dedicated to specific and honest accounts of both internal and external events." "Against the eclectic background of his work in national sample surveys, studies based on semi-structured interviewing, and participant observation, Weiss walks the reader through the method of qualitative interview studies: sample selection, development of an interview guide, the conduct of the interview, analysis, and preparation of data. Weiss gives examples of successful and less successful interviews, enhanced by a sidebar of his own running commentary on how each interaction between interviewer and respondent inhibits or promotes this essential alliance. He offers specific techniques and guidelines - equally helpful to the seasoned professional or beginning graduate student - which he has found useful over many years of asking people to "tell me about it."" "Learning from Strangers is a reference guide, an essential text, and a memoir of the experience of doing research. It recounts the emotional experience of being interviewed, the likelihood of respondents telling the truth, and the ethical defensibility of interviewing. Qualitative interview materials have helped Weiss bring to readers the pain of bereavement, the desperate restlessness of loneliness, and the confusions attendant on divorce. Learning from Strangers will be useful to all those who use qualitative research interviews to gather data."--BOOK JACKET.},

Second, 'What is an author?' systematically mystified the figure of the text, even as it clarified the figure of the author by revealing that figure to be an interpretative construct. Third, Foucault's achievement was vitiated by the terms in which it was cast, for his concept of the 'author-function' obliterated the personal quality of the author-figure. It is suggested in conclusion that all such interpretative figures--'text' as well as 'author', and many others besides--merit critical analysis, since these embody the fore-having which precedes interpretation.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalences of perceived honorary authorship and International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE)-defined honorary authorship, and identify factors affecting each rate in the physical medicine and rehabilitation literature.

DESIGN: Internet-based survey.

SETTING: Not applicable.

PARTICIPANTS: First authors of articles published in 3 major physical medicine and rehabilitation journals between January 2009 and December 2011 were surveyed in June and July 2012 (N=1182).

INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The reported prevalences of perceived and ICMJE-defined honorary authorship were the primary outcome measures, and multiple factors were analyzed to determine whether they were associated with these measures.

RESULTS: The response rate was 27.3\% (248/908). The prevalences of perceived and ICMJE-defined honorary authorship were 18.0\% (44/244) and 55.2\% (137/248), respectively. Factors associated with perceived honorary authorship in the multivariate analysis included the suggestion that an honorary author should be included (P{\textless}.0001), being a medical resident or fellow (P=.0019), listing "reviewed manuscript" as 1 of the nonauthorship tasks (P=.0013), and the most senior author deciding the authorship order (P=.0469). Living outside North America was independently associated with ICMJE-defined honorary authorship (P=.0079) in the multivariate analysis. In the univariate analysis, indicating that the most senior author decided authorship order was significantly associated with ICMJE-defined honorary authorship (P={\textless}.001).

CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that honorary authorship does occur in a significant proportion of the physical medicine and rehabilitation literature. Additionally, we found several factors associated with perceived and ICMJE-defined honorary authorship and a discrepancy between the 2 rates. Further studies with larger response rates are recommended to further explore this topic.},

Furthermore, we show that these vectors provide state-of-the-art performance on our test set for measuring syntactic and semantic word similarities.},

Since then, happily for researchers, the developers of each product have been leapfrogging each other with features, and new announcements and claims seem to be forthcoming every week. There have been numerous articles and analyses on the Scopus product alone (Fingerman 2005) and on comparisons between Scopus, the Web of Science and more recently Google Scholar (Bakkalbasi 2006; Burnham 2006; Dess 2006; Deis and Goodman 2005; Jacso 2004; Jacso 2005; LaGuardia 2005). I will leave descriptions of and opinions on the interfaces of each product to those authors and indeed to the preferences of the users. As with all things web, these interfaces change frequently and may have been redesigned by the time you read this review. This article will focus on capabilities and features of each product, current as of October 2006, rather than on the itemization and comparison of subjective search results. Once again, those types of analysis were amply covered in the papers cited above. As many of the previous articles have also pointed out, much of the utility and beauty of these products are in the eye of the beholder and will satisfy different information requirements to different degrees. As Burnham states, "Neither database is inclusive, but complements each other." That is why the review title uses "and" instead of "vs." However, I will also pull out some of the caveats that I feel are particularly important.},

	abstract = {The author order of multi-authored papers can reveal subtle patterns of scientific collaboration and provide insights on the nature of credit assignment among coauthors. This article proposes a sequence-based perspective on scientific collaboration. Using frequently occurring sequences as the unit of analysis, this study explores (1) what types of sequence patterns are most common in the scientific collaboration at the level of authors, institutions, U.S. states, and nations in Library and Information Science (LIS); and (2) the productivity (measured by number of papers) and influence (measured by citation counts) of different types of sequence patterns. Results show that (1) the productivity and influence approximately follow the power law for frequent sequences in the four levels of analysis; (2) the productivity and influence present a significant positive correlation among frequent sequences, and the strength of the correlation increases with the level of integration; (3) for author-level, institution-level, and state-level frequent sequences, short geographical distances between the authors usually co-present with high productivities, while long distances tend to co-occur with large citation counts; (4) for author-level frequent sequences, the pattern of “the more productive and prestigious authors ranking ahead” is the one with the highest productivity and the highest influence; however, in the rest of the levels of analysis, the pattern with the highest productivity and the highest influence is the one with “the less productive and prestigious institutions/states/nations ranking ahead.”},

Previous methods either profess ignorance about the seniority of co-authors (egalitarian weights) or are based in an ad hoc way on the order of authors (rank weights). Pareto weights are based on the respective citation records of the co-authors. Pareto weights are proportional to the probability of observing the number of citations obtained. Assuming a Pareto distribution, such weights can be computed with a simple, closed-form equation but require a few iterations and data on a scholar, her co-authors, and her co-authors' co-authors. The use of Pareto weights is illustrated with a group of prominent economists. In this case, Pareto weights are very different from rank weights. Pareto weights are more similar to egalitarian weights but can deviate up to a quarter in either direction (for reasons that are intuitive).},

Harmonic counting meets these concerns by exhibiting a robust fit to previously published empirical data from medicine, psychology and chemistry, and by complying with three basic ethical criteria for the equitable sharing of authorship credit. Harmonic counting can also incorporate additional byline information about equal contribution, or the elevated status of a corresponding last author. By contrast, several previously proposed counting schemes from the bibliometric literature including arithmetic, geometric and fractional counting, do not fit the empirical data as well and do not consistently meet the ethical criteria. In conclusion, harmonic counting would seem to provide unrivalled accuracy, fairness and flexibility to the long overdue task of standardizing bibliometric allocation of publication and citation credit.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Determining authorship for publications is often a difficult process, even more so when individuals from several disciplines collaborate with community organizations to conduct projects. Although multidisciplinary and community-academic partnerships provide fertile ground for publication efforts, disputes about authorship and ownership of data may hinder efforts to disseminate information. This article describes a process for dealing with authorship in multi-professional collaborations. It provides an authorship scale, similar to a neonatal Apgar scale, to determine order of authorship in multi-professional projects. Key components or activities in the process of authorship are identified, and points are assigned to each component in proportion to an investigator's level of activity in each component/activity. Scores are summed and can range from 1 to 35 for each author. The order of authorship is then determined by the relative score of each participant.},

	url = {http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=712680},
	abstract = {Background: Authorship disputes and abuses have increased in recent years. In response to a proposal that researcher contributions be specified for readers, The Lancet began disclosing such contributions at the end of original articles. Objective: To analyze the descriptions researchers use for their contributions and to determine how the order of names on the byline corresponds to these contributions, whether persons listed on the byline fulfill a lenient version of the criteria for authorship specified by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (the Vancouver Group), and whether the contributions of persons listed as contributors overlap with the contributions of those who are acknowledged. Design: Descriptive study. Measurements: A taxonomy of researchers' contributions was developed and applied to researchers' self-reported contributions to original research articles published in The Lancet from July to December 1997. Results: Contributors lists occupied little page space (mean, 2.5 cm of column length). Placement on the byline did not indicate the specific category of task performed, although the first-contributor position corresponded to a significantly greater number of contributions (mean numbers of contributions: first-contributor position, 3.23; second-contributor position, 2.51; third-contributor position, 2.20; and fourth-contributor position, 2.51) (P {\textless} 0.01). Forty-four percent of contributors on the byline did not fulfill a lenient version of the Vancouver Group's criteria for authorship. Sixty percent of the most common categories of activities described on contributors lists overlapped with those on acknowledgments lists. Conclusions: Publication of lists that specify contributions to research articles is feasible and seems to impart important information. The criteria for authorship outlined by the Vancouver Group do not seem to be congruent with the self-identified contributions of researchers.},

The holdings and citation records of these four databases were assessed against two sets of data one drawn from the 2001 Research Assessment Exercise and the other from the International bibliography of the Social Sciences. Initially, CSA Illumina's coverage at journal title level appeared to be the most comprehensive. But when recall and average citation count was tested at article level and rankings extrapolated by submission frequency to individual journal titles, Scopus was ranked first. When issues of functionality, the quality of record processing and depth of coverage are taken into account, Scopus and Web of Science have a significant advantage over the other two databases. From this analysis, Scopus offers the best coverage from amongst these databases and could be used as an alternative to the Web of Science as a tool to evaluate the research impact in the social sciences.},

	abstract = {Whereas recent scholarly research has provided many insights about universities engaging in commercial activities, there is still little empirical evidence regarding the opposite phenomenon of companies disseminating scientific knowledge. Our paper aims to fill this gap and explores the motivations of firms that disclose research outcomes in a scientific format. Besides considering a dimension internal to the firm, we focus particularly on knowledge sourcing from academic institutions and the appropriability regime. We conduct an econometric analysis with firm-level data from the fourth edition of the French innovation survey (CIS) and matched scientific publications for a sample of 2512 R\&D performing firms from all manufacturing sectors. This analysis provides evidence that firms are more likely to adopt academic principles if they need to access scientific knowledge that is considered important for their innovation development, whereas the mere existence of collaborative links with academic institutions is not a strong determinant. Furthermore, the results suggest that the inclination of firms to publish is sensitive to the level of knowledge spillovers in a sector and the effectiveness of legal appropriation instruments.},

	abstract = {Depuis une trentaine d'années, de nombreux travaux ont montré la place croissante que tiennent le marché et la capitalisation des connaissances dans la production scientifique. Cette marchandisation est généralement perçue comme contraire aux valeurs académiques qui promulguent la recherche désintéressée, le don et la non propriété. Pourtant, l'analyse de la signature des articles scientifiques proposée dans ce texte oriente vers une autre direction. L'économie des pratiques de signature soutient, au sein même de la recherche académique, plusieurs régimes d'échange qui tirent leur pertinence l'un de l'autre. La « science » apparaît alors moins comme une sphère autonome, opposée au « marché », que comme le lieu de tensions entre différents formes de commerce avec les personnes et les choses. Cette perspective révèle aussi la place particulière attribuée au « travail » dans les activités scientifiques.},

	abstract = {Knowledge disclosure plays a central role in models of economic growth. In this paper, we provide a theoretical model that evaluates the conditions supporting disclosures of privately funded knowledge through scientific publication, patenting, or both. Our analysis is grounded in the conflicting incentives facing researchers and their funders: scientists have incentives to disclose discoveries through scientific publication while firms have incentives to protect their ideas through patenting or secrecy. We focus on the strategic interaction between researchers and firms bargaining over whether (and how) knowledge will be disclosed. We evaluate four different disclosure strategies: secrecy, commercial science (patenting), open science (scientific publication) and patent-paper pairs (disclosure along both dimensions). Our model then derives the conditions under which each of these outcomes emerges and offers insights into the determinants of the disclosure strategy of a firm. Importantly, we find that patents and publications are complementary instruments in facilitating the disclosure of scientific knowledge; thereby providing a microeconomic unpinning of assumptions commonly made in endogenous growth models as well as a framework for understanding the impact of patent protection on the openness of science.},

This study aims to be the first to use these methods to trace the impact, or success, of digitised scholarly resources in the Humanities. Running alongside a number of other methods of measuring impact online, the webometric study described here also aims to assess whether it is possible to measure a resource's impact using webometric analysis. Design/methodology/approach – Link data were collected for five target project sites and a range of comparator sites. Findings – The results show that digitised resources online can leave traces that can be identified and used to assess their impact. Where digitised resources are situated on shifting URLs, or amalgamated into larger online resources, their impact is difficult to measure with these methods, however. Originality/value – This study is the first to use webometric methods to probe the impact of digitised scholarly resources in the Humanities.},

Scientists that are moving along applied research trajectories find it easier to produce industrial applications than their colleagues engaged in the quest for very fundamental understanding.We interpret our results by suggesting that, for the former, more academic research results in more exploitable results, hence in more chances to patent; for the latter, more academic research makes it just more unlikely that they will find the time to produce industrial applications.

	abstract = {This paper explores the determinants of inventorship attribution in academic patents, compared to those of authorship attribution. Starting from a sample of 308 italian scientists, we have selected 681 patent-publication pairs in different disciplinary fields (i.e. the patent and the publication describe the same invention) using text mining techniques and we have found that the number of authors is larger than the numbers of inventors. In order to understand who is excluded from inventorship, we have measured each authors contribution using the position in the publication byline. The econometric analysis shows that the first and the last authors have a relatively lower probability to be excluded. We have shown however that - controlling for individual contribution - seniority matters and that other things being equal professional experience reduces the probability of exclusion. In particular a ten year increase of professional experience decreases the probability of exclusion of first authors in the byline by 0.16 and of last authors of 0.13. This paper contributes to the literature on academic patents (as we envisage potential room for litigation) and to the debate on the criteria of authorship in science.},

For academic teams that both publish and patent their research results, we can compare the social and legal norms that regulate the joint distribution of these two types of attribution rights. We use text-mining techniques to identify 681 “patent-publication pairs” (related sets of patents and publications), for a sample of Italian academic scientists. On average, the number of co- authors is larger than the number of co-inventors, especially in medical-related fields. First and last authors have a lower probability of being excluded from inventorship, as suggested by patent laws. However, the probability of exclusion also declines with seniority, as expected from social norms. Long- lasting doubts on the reliability of authorship as a tool for allocating scientific credit are reinforced, and can be extended to inventorship.},

Assignment to inventor-related start-ups is less likely the higher the share of revenue inventors receive from university-licensed patents. Firm assignment also varies by inventor field and whether the university is public or private.},

	doi = {10.1097/01.ACM.0000250027.48685.ca},
	abstract = {CONTEXT: The Bayh-Dole Act and renewed emphasis on translational research have stimulated patenting activities at universities. PURPOSE: To examine how different institutions manage possible patent-related conflicts of interest in human subjects research, and to provide an ethical analysis and recommendations. METHOD: Policies of nine major professional organizations, 13 of the largest recipients of federal biomedical funding in the United States and Canada, and 17 biomedical journals were canvassed. Disagreements in policies were used as the basis for analyzing the ethics of inventorship in clinical trials. RESULTS: Policies varied along three lines. First, some policies did not define patent inventorship as a potential conflict of interest. Second, some of those that did define it as such used licensing as a trigger for conflict of interest management. Third, several policies imposed presumptive restrictions on an investigator's participation in a trial involving his or her invention. CONCLUSIONS: The author defends on ethical grounds restrictive policies on patent holding in clinical trials and rejects objections to restrictive policies. The author recommends five policies: (1) any related patent holding should always be disclosed to IRBs and research subjects, (2) investigators who hold conflicting patents should be presumptively barred from certain activities in a study, (3) institutional interests in patents should be managed and disclosed to research subjects, (4) IRBs should also be informed of an investigator's filed (not just held) patents on an experimental agent, and (5) the stringency of policies should be adjusted according to a patent's earning potential and the risk associated with a study.},

This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2 million customers and by analysing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad hoc modular networks.},

The definition of the appropriate form of communication is part of how a discipline constitutes itself, and is part of the achievement of that discipline. This paper examines the changing features of spectroscopic articles in Physical Review since its founding. Analyses of article length, use of references, sentence length and syntax, vocabulary, graphic features, organization and argument indicate that articles become increasingly theory-based and knowledge-embedded through time. Self-consciousness about the theoretical character of argument also increases. The changing character of communication within a scientific community also has implications for the social structure of that community.},

A total of 1308 papers published in scientific journals was examined. There were weak but statistically significant trends in the increase in the number of authors per paper as well as in the number of multi-authored papers written by authors from different institutions, with the passage of time. Possible reasons for these results include the increasing specialization of researchers necessitating collaboration, more access to electronic means of communication, and more competition for research funds. Confounding factors in this analysis include the possibility that different journals have different publication patterns and regional vs. national/international journal differences.},

At the University of California San Diego, a faculty committee evaluated 135 publications of Robert Slutsky, MD, and reported to each of the corresponding 30 journals whether each article was valid, questionable, or fraudulent, requesting publication of the criteria and the conclusions. Journals responded slowly to this request; half required additional letters over a 2-year period to elicit a reply. Of the 13 journals that had only valid articles, 5 printed a statement to that effect. Statements concerning 46 of 60 nonvalid articles were eventually published. Journals' inconsistent identification of published statements made it difficult to retrieve them by electronic searching. Only 7 notices covering 15 articles were found by searching under the Medical Subject Heading "Retraction of Publication"; scanning the entire bibliography retrieved 18 articles with retraction notations. A poll showed that journals rarely have written procedures for responding to allegations of research misconduct; in our experience, journals were reluctant to accept authorized retractions or corrections when coauthors failed to act.(JAMA. 1990;263:1416-1419)},

Investigators, research ethics committees, funding bodies, and scientific editors all have responsibilities to reduce underreporting of clinical trials.

There was no evidence that small, obscure journals, non-US journals, or non-US authors were disproportionately responsible for these citations. Although, after retraction, US authors accounted for a smaller percentage of citations, they continued to be the single greatest source. Several possible reasons why invalid information continues to be used were identified. These included a dearth of available information on retracted works; inconsistency in retraction format, terminology, and indexing; and an apparent lack of sufficient attention to manuscripts by some authors and editors.(JAMA. 1990;263:1420-1423)},

	abstract = {BackgroundCitation analysis has become an important tool for research performance assessment in the medical sciences. However, different areas of medical research may have considerably different citation practices, even within the same medical field. Because of this, it is unclear to what extent citation-based bibliometric indicators allow for valid comparisons between research units active in different areas of medical research.MethodologyA visualization methodology is introduced that reveals differences in citation practices between medical research areas. The methodology extracts terms from the titles and abstracts of a large collection of publications and uses these terms to visualize the structure of a medical field and to indicate how research areas within this field differ from each other in their average citation impact.ResultsVisualizations are provided for 32 medical fields, defined based on journal subject categories in the Web of Science database. The analysis focuses on three fields: Cardiac \& cardiovascular systems, Clinical neurology, and Surgery. In each of these fields, there turn out to be large differences in citation practices between research areas. Low-impact research areas tend to focus on clinical intervention research, while high-impact research areas are often more oriented on basic and diagnostic research.ConclusionsPopular bibliometric indicators, such as the h-index and the impact factor, do not correct for differences in citation practices between medical fields. These indicators therefore cannot be used to make accurate between-field comparisons. More sophisticated bibliometric indicators do correct for field differences but still fail to take into account within-field heterogeneity in citation practices. As a consequence, the citation impact of clinical intervention research may be substantially underestimated in comparison with basic and diagnostic research.},

	url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0068397},
	abstract = {BackgroundThe number of retracted scientific publications has risen sharply, but it is unclear whether this reflects an increase in publication of flawed articles or an increase in the rate at which flawed articles are withdrawn.Methods and FindingsWe examined the interval between publication and retraction for 2,047 retracted articles indexed in PubMed. Time-to-retraction (from publication of article to publication of retraction) averaged 32.91 months. Among 714 retracted articles published in or before 2002, retraction required 49.82 months; among 1,333 retracted articles published after 2002, retraction required 23.82 months (p{\textless}0.0001). This suggests that journals are retracting papers more quickly than in the past, although recent articles requiring retraction may not have been recognized yet. To test the hypothesis that time-to-retraction is shorter for articles that receive careful scrutiny, time-to-retraction was correlated with journal impact factor (IF). Time-to-retraction was significantly shorter for high-IF journals, but only ∼1\% of the variance in time-to-retraction was explained by increased scrutiny. The first article retracted for plagiarism was published in 1979 and the first for duplicate publication in 1990, showing that articles are now retracted for reasons not cited in the past. The proportional impact of authors with multiple retractions was greater in 1972–1992 than in the current era (p{\textless}0.001). From 1972–1992, 46.0\% of retracted papers were written by authors with a single retraction; from 1993 to 2012, 63.1\% of retracted papers were written by single-retraction authors (p{\textless}0.001).ConclusionsThe increase in retracted articles appears to reflect changes in the behavior of both authors and institutions. Lower barriers to publication of flawed articles are seen in the increase in number and proportion of retractions by authors with a single retraction. Lower barriers to retraction are apparent in an increase in retraction for “new” offenses such as plagiarism and a decrease in the time-to-retraction of flawed work.},

Its effects on scientists, their work and their relationships are seldom considered. Focus-group discussions with 51 mid- and early-career scientists, on which this study is based, reveal a dark side of competition in science. According to these scientists, competition contributes to strategic game-playing in science, a decline in free and open sharing of information and methods, sabotage of others' ability to use one's work, interference with peer-review processes, deformation of relationships, and careless or questionable research conduct. When competition is pervasive, such effects may jeopardize the progress, efficiency and integrity of science.},

The field responded with suggestions of how fraud could be prevented. However, the Stapel fraud is only one among many cases. Before basing recommendations on one case, it would be informative to study other cases to assess how these frauds were discovered. The authors analyze a convenience sample of fraud cases to see whether (social) psychology is more susceptible to fraud than other disciplines. They also evaluate whether the peer review process and replications work well in practice to detect fraud. There is no evidence that psychology is more vulnerable to fraud than the biomedical sciences, and most frauds are detected through information from whistleblowers with inside information. On the basis of this analysis, the authors suggest a number of strategies that might reduce the risk of scientific fraud.},

	abstract = {Ever since the SCI was launched in the 1960s, it has indexed published retractions. In each case, a citation link was established between the retraction, that is, “correction,” and the original source article. To find retractions, like all other corrections, all one had to do was conduct a cited reference search based on the author, journal, and year of publication of the retracted paper. This would yield a list of all items that cited the original work, including the retractions, which, like all other corrections, would be coded as such. However, in 1996, the SCI amplified its treatment of retractions by including the notation for the retraction together with the bibliographic citation for the source item. If one does a search on a subject or an author and finds a paper that has been retracted, the retraction can be seen immediately adjacent to the source entry. Thus, for example, the entry for W.S. Hwang's 2005 paper in Science on patient-specific embryonic stem cells is followed by SCIENCE 311 (5759): 335-335 JAN 20 2006, the imprint data for the retraction. When one conducts a cited reference search on the original paper (Hwang HS, Science, 2005), one immediately sees the statement, “This article was retracted see Science 311, 335, Jan. 20, 2006.”},

In their evaluative function, they winnow out research that is unlikely to stand up to independent verification; this task is accomplished by peer review. In their editorial function, they try to ensure transparent (by which we mean clear, complete, and unambiguous) and objective descriptions of the research. Both the evaluative and editorial functions go largely unnoticed by the publicâ€”the former only draws public attention when a journal publishes fraudulent research. However, both play a critical role in the progress of science. This paper is about both functions.

	abstract = {To evaluate the extent of the problem of scientific misconduct in investigational drug trials, we reviewed data from 1955 routine audits conducted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from June 1977 to April 1988. Serious deficiencies were detected in 12\% of audits prior to October 1985, but in only 7\% since that date. At the same time, there was no evidence of a decline over time in the rate of detection of many categories of deficiencies, and some investigators were able to continue to participate in drug trials after flagrant violations of recognized norms of research. The data auditing program should be continued, but additional measures are needed to regulate misconduct. These must be tailored to the variety of causes of misconduct, ranging from negligence to fraud. Possible additional approaches could include certifying the competence of potential investigators; peer-reviewed, competitive application for the opportunity to conduct FDA-authorized clinical trials; limiting an investigator's level of participation in clinical trials; penalizing manufacturers who fail to detect their investigators' misconduct; and permitting the FDA to suspend investigators prior to a hearing. Measures taken should maximize public utility at the least economic cost to society and should be evaluated thoroughly.(JAMA. 1989;261:2505-2511)},

Perhaps readers have never personally encountered or recognized a case of plagiarism so its immediate interest and relevance may be obscure. A short case history may provide evidence that the issue of plagiarism is germane to the contemporary academic endeavor. A young university radiologist recognized his own writing in a professional journal under another's authorship, without attribution to himself, and had no idea what to do about it. He finally wrote to the author of the article who answered something to the effect that it was indeed a "remarkable coincidence" and that "great minds think alike." Unsatisfied with the response, he considered reporting the matter to the journal editor, but he was a junior faculty member while the plagiarist was a revered figure in his subspecialty. He chose not to pursue the issue further because he was afraid that the plagiarist would harm him professionally 1.},

There are many forms of scientific dishonesty ranging from very serious to just below the limit of what is permissible, and it occurs at all stages of scientific research. Tracing fraud is by no means easy and its discovery is often only accidental. American, British and Dutch incidences are reported. We know the causes of fraud to be profit-seeking in all its forms, vanity and sloppy research practice. Oddly enough, the consequences of fraud are often more advantageous to the perpetrators than to the whistle-blowers. Literature becomes polluted and faith in scientific knowledge is damaged. In summary the measures and sanctions employed to combat fraud in the United States, Scandinavia, the United Kingdom and The Netherlands, are described. In The Netherlands are recently two commissions appointed. Points of discussion include: a governmental or other commission organized at a national or regional level, what protocol should be implemented, should the commission have powers of sanction, for how long should the members of commission be appointed and how is the extent of their liabilities to be decided upon?},

We demonstrate that new insights may be gained when discussing the Hwang case against the background of the establishment of a specific framing called ethicising.

These self-references may result from the cumulative nature of individual research, the need for personal gratification, or the value of self-citation as a rhetorical and tactical tool in the struggle for visibility and scientific authority. In this article we examine the incentives that underlie self-citation by studying how authors' references to their own works affect the citations they receive from others. We report the results of a macro study of more than half a million citations to articles by Norwegian scientists that appeared in the Science Citation Index. We show that the more one cites oneself the more one is cited by other scholars. Controlling for numerous sources of variation in cumulative citations from others, our models suggest that each additional self-citation increases the number of citations from others by about one after one year, and by about three after five years. Moreover, there is no significant penalty for the most frequent self-citers - the effect of self-citation remains positive even for very high rates of self-citation. These results carry important policy implications for the use of citations to evaluate performance and distribute resources in science and they represent new information on the role and impact of self-citations in scientific communication. 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

However, the measurement error of citation analysis can be large due to these and other factors, introducing considerable noise and potential bias.

However, there is limited knowledge about the relative citation impact of articles using various study designs. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the type of study design affects the rate of citation in subsequent articles. DESIGN AND SETTING: We measured the citation impact of articles using various study designs-including meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, case reports, nonsystematic reviews, and decision analysis or cost-effectiveness analysis-published in 1991 and in 2001 for a sample of 2646 articles. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The citation count through the end of the second year after the year of publication and the total received citations. RESULTS: Meta-analyses received more citations than any other study design both in 1991 (P{\textless}.05 for all comparisons) and in 2001 (P{\textless}.001 for all comparisons) and both in the first 2 years and in the longer term. More than 10 citations in the first 2 years were received by 32.4\% of meta-analyses published in 1991 and 43.6\% of meta-analyses published in 2001. Randomized controlled trials did not differ significantly from epidemiological studies and nonsystematic review articles in 1991 but clearly became the second-cited study design in 2001. Epidemiological studies, nonsystematic review articles, and decision and cost-effectiveness analyses had relatively similar impact; case reports received negligible citations. Meta-analyses were cited significantly more often than all other designs after adjusting for year of publication, high journal impact factor, and country of origin. When limited to studies addressing treatment effects, meta-analyses received more citations than randomized trials. CONCLUSION: Overall, the citation impact of various study designs is commensurate with most proposed hierarchies of evidence.},

	abstract = {Objective To evaluate changes in the role of academics and the sources of funding for the medical research cited most frequently over the past decade. Design Database analysis. Data sources Web of Knowledge database. Methods For each year from 1994 to 2003, articles in the domain of clinical medicine that had been cited most often by the end of 2004 were identified. Changes in author's affiliations and funding sources were evaluated. Results Of the 289 frequently cited articles, most had at least one author with a university (76\%) or hospital (57\%) affiliation, and the proportion of articles with each type of affiliation was constant over time. Government or public funding was most common (60\% of articles), followed by industry (36\%). The proportion of most frequently cited articles funded by industry increased over time (odds ratio 1.17 per year, P = 0.001) and was equal to the proportion funded by government or public sources by 2001. 65 of the 77 most cited randomised controlled trials received funding from industry, and the proportion increased significantly over time (odds ratio 1.59 per year, P = 0.003). 18 of the 32 most cited trials published after 1999 were funded by industry alone. Conclusion Academic affiliations remain prominent among the authors of the most frequently cited medical research. Such research is increasingly funded by industry, often exclusively so. Academics may be losing control of the clinical research agenda.},

We examine the strong link between bibliometrics and the Thomson Scientific's database and review the differences in the production and diffusion of knowledge in the social sciences and humanities (SSH) and the natural sciences and engineering (NSE). This leads to a re-examination of the debate on the coverage of these databases, more specifically in the SSH. The methods section explains how we have compared the coverage of Thomson Scientific databases in the NSE and SSH to the Ulrich extensive database of journals. Our results show that there is a 20 to 25\% overrepresentation of English-language journals in Thomson Scientific's databases compared to the list of journals presented in Ulrich. This paper concludes that because of this bias, Thomson Scientific databases cannot be used in isolation to benchmark the output of countries in the SSH.},

The citation frequency for scientific publications, as given in the Science Citation Index, is influenced by various forms of citation bias as well as by the characteristic dynamics and citation practices of the various scientific fields, and therefore cannot be taken as an unequivocal measure of scientific quality. Even for single authors the citation frequency is very variable; therefore this parameter should not be used for graded evaluation of individual scientists or research groups.

The journal impact factor, i.e. the mean citation frequency of all articles in a journal, has been suggested as a rapid indicator of article quality. However, the distribution of citation frequency values within a journal is extremely broad and skewed; therefore, assigning the same value to all articles would not seem to serve the purpose of evaluation particularly well. Furthermore, the citation frequencies of articles published by individual authors or research groups are found to correlate extremely poorly with the corresponding journal impact factors.

@article{zitt_relativity_2005,
	title = {Relativity of citation performance and excellence measures: {From} cross-field to cross-scale effects of field-normalisation},
	volume = {63},
	abstract = {As citation practices strongly depend on fields, field normalisation is recognised as necessary for fair comparison of figures in bibliometrics and evaluation studies. However fields may be defined at various levels, from small research areas to broad academic disciplines, and thus normalisation values are expected to vary. The aim of this project was to test the stability of citation ratings of articles as the level of observation - hence the basis of normalisation - changes. A conventional classification of science based on ISI subject categories and their aggregates at various scales was used, namely at five levels: all science, large academic discipline, sub-discipline, speciality and journal. Among various normalisation methods, we selected a simple ranking method (quantiles), based on the citation score of the article in each particular aggregate (journal, speciality, etc.) it belonged to at each level. The study was conducted on articles in the full SCI range, for publication year 1998 with a four-year citation window. Stability is measured in three ways: overall comparison of article rankings; individual trajectory of articles; survival of the top-cited class across levels. Overall rank correlations on the observed empirical structure are benchmarked against two fictitious sets that keep the same embedded structure of articles but reassign citation scores either in a totally ordered or in a totally random distribution. These sets act respectively as a 'worst case' and 'best case' for the stability of citation ratings. The results show that: (a) the average citation rankings of articles substantially change with the level of observation (b) observation at the journal level is very particular, and the results differ greatly in all test circumstances from all the other levels of observation (c) the lack of cross-scale stability is confirmed when looking at the distribution of individual trajectories of articles across the levels; (d) when considering the top-cited fractions, a standard measure of excellence, it is found that the contents of the 'top-cited' set is completely dependent on the level of observation. The instability of impact measures should not be interpreted in terms of lack of robustness but rather as the co-existence of various perspectives each having their own form of legitimacy. A follow-up study will focus on the micro levels of observation and will be based on a structure built around bibliometric groupings rather than conventional groupings based on ISI subject categories.

	volume = {7},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0047210},
	abstract = {A Kuhnian approach to research assessment requires us to consider that the important scientific breakthroughs that drive scientific progress are infrequent and that the progress of science does not depend on normal research. Consequently, indicators of research performance based on the total number of papers do not accurately measure scientific progress. Similarly, those universities with the best reputations in terms of scientific progress differ widely from other universities in terms of the scale of investments made in research and in the higher concentrations of outstanding scientists present, but less so in terms of the total number of papers or citations. This study argues that indicators for the 1\% high-citation tail of the citation distribution reveal the contribution of universities to the progress of science and provide quantifiable justification for the large investments in research made by elite research universities. In this tail, which follows a power low, the number of the less frequent and highly cited important breakthroughs can be predicted from the frequencies of papers in the upper part of the tail. This study quantifies the false impression of excellence produced by multinational papers, and by other types of papers that do not contribute to the progress of science. Many of these papers are concentrated in and dominate lists of highly cited papers, especially in lower-ranked universities. The h-index obscures the differences between higher- and lower-ranked universities because the proportion of h-core papers in the 1\% high-citation tail is not proportional to the value of the h-index.},

Databases and their delivery mechanism have provided both the source of raw data, as well as the analytical tools for many informetric studies. In particular, the citation databases produced by the Institute for Scientific Information have been the key source of data for a whole range of citation-based research. However, there are also many problems and challenges associated with the use of online databases. Most of the problems arise because databases are designed primarily for information retrieval purposes, and informetric studies represent only a secondary use of the systems. The sorts of problems encountered by informetricians include: errors or inconsistency in the data itself; problems with the coverage, overlap and changeability of the databases; as well as problems and limitations in the tools provided by the database hosts such as DIALOG. For some informetric studies, the only viable solution to these problems is to download the data and perform offline correction and data analysis.},

From the bibliometric viewpoint we can conclude that that there is no reason for condemning self-citations in general or for removing them from macro or meso statistics; supplementary indicators based on self-citations are, nonetheless, useful to understand communication patterns.

This is in contrast to the set of all authors with whom a given author has been co-cited, the author's citation image. The image is determined by others citing habits; the identity by one's own. By forming an author's oeuvre on DIALOG and then ranking her cited authors continuously, one forms the author's identity. By selecting all papers that contain the author as a cited author and then ranking the cited authors in this set, one produces the author's image. Citation identities were created for eight information scientists using only first or sole author papers. Documents with no references were eliminated from consideration. The limited set of ISI journals and their time of coverage limits accuracy as does the lack of credit for other than first author pieces. Homonymic names and multiple names for the same person are common problems. The eight author sets are Bradfordian and individualized with 3\% to 8\% self citation. Three citing styles are apparent: scientific, with heavy recitation; bibliographic essay, with little recitation; and literature review, with many authors and much recitation.},

Recent years have seen a rising trend in the number of articles published, multiple authorship, and internationalization of the biomedical literature. The goal of this study was to analyze the trends in authorship over the past 50 years to determine whether the orthopedic literature parallels trends seen in other areas of the biomedical literature. We performed an observational study with analysis of the number of authors and geographic origin of articles published in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery British Volume (JBJS) and Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (CORR). We analyzed 2776 articles (CORR, n=1809; JBJS, n=967) published between 1958 and 2008 at 10-year intervals. There has been a significant increase in the mean number of authors per article from 1.638 to 4.08 (P{\textless}.0001) and 1.633 to 4.540 (P{\textless}.0001) for CORR and JBJS, respectively between 1958 and 2008. There has been a significant increase in the international contribution to both journals (P{\textless}.0001). The number of countries contributing to articles increased from 5 to 39 and from 17 to 33 for CORR and JBJS, respectively. These findings are similar to other areas of the biomedical literature. The reasons for this proliferation are multifactorial, including multicenter trials and inappropriate authorship. Guidelines for authorship and preparation of manuscripts from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors or from individual journals are widely available, and every effort should be made to adhere to them to prevent inappropriate authorship proliferation in the future.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT Authorship in biomedical publications establishes accountability, responsibility, and credit. Misappropriation of authorship undermines the integrity of the authorship system, but accurate data on its prevalence are limited. OBJECTIVES To determine the prevalence of articles with honorary authors (named authors who have not met authorship criteria) and ghost authors (individuals not named as authors but who contributed substantially to the work) in peer-reviewed medical journals and to identify journal characteristics and article types associated with such authorship misappropriation. DESIGN Mailed, self-administered, confidential survey. PARTICIPANTS A total of 809 corresponding authors (1179 surveyed, 69\% response rate) of articles published in 1996 in 3 peer-reviewed, large-circulation general medical journals (Annals of Internal Medicine, JAMA, and The New England Journal of Medicine) and 3 peer-reviewed, smaller-circulation journals that publish supplements (American Journal of Cardiology, American Journal of Medicine, and American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Prevalence of articles with honorary authors and ghost authors, as reported by corresponding authors. RESULTS Of the 809 articles, 492 were original research reports, 240 were reviews and articles not reporting original data, and 77 were editorials. A total of 156 articles (1 9\%) had evidence of honorary authors (range, 11\%-25\% among journals); 93 articles (11\%) had evidence of ghost authors (range, 7\%-16\% among journals); and 13 articles (2\%) had evidence of both. The prevalence of articles with honorary authors was greater among review articles than research articles (odds ratio [OR], 1.8; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-2.6) but did not differ significantly between large-circulation and smaller-circulation journals (OR, 1.4; 95\% CI, 0.96-2.03). Compared with similar-type articles in large-circulation journals, articles with ghost authors in smaller-circulation journals were more likely to be reviews (OR, 4.2; 95\% CI, 1.5-13.5) and less likely to be research articles (OR, 0.49; 95\% CI, 0.27-0.88). CONCLUSION A substantial proportion of articles in peer-reviewed medical journals demonstrate evidence of honorary authors or ghost authors.},

In the last 30 years there has been a dramatic increase, not only in the volume of publications but in the number of authors per article as well. This paper summarizes the current literature on authorship and its proliferation in medicine. From the literature it becomes clear that for biomedical articles, the mean number of authors increased from 1.7 in 1960 to 3.1 in 1990, and there are indications that this trend is even greater in clinical medicine such that single authorship almost has disappeared. Formal guidelines of who should be considered an author have been set by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. There are studies suggesting that not all authors on multiauthor papers fulfill these criteria. Inappropriate multiple authorship leads to dilution of authorship responsibility and unjustified citation in curriculum vitae. Recommendations regarding the prevention of inappropriate authorship are given in this paper.},

There seems to be an increasing trend of multiple author articles published across most journals. As the field of biomedical engineering also encompasses multidisciplinary-based knowledge, it is interesting to understand the authorship trend over time. In this study, six journals were carefully chosen from the Journal Citation Report of the Thomson Scientific based on predefined criteria (year 1999 to 2008). The data pertaining to authorships for the articles published in these journals were then acquired from the PubMed database. The results show that there is a general upward trend for the number of author per article, but it is not significant (p {\textgreater} .01) despite a 64.5\% increase in the total number of article published in the six chosen journals. Thus, the expected increase is not observed in this field, and it may be due to the stringent guidelines by journals in defining the contributions of an author. Particularly, contributing factors like the impact of authorship irregularities is discussed herein.},

The four authors presented 364, 349, 96, and 70 papers. If an equal contribution of all coauthors is assumed, the actual number of papers (all papers divided by the number of authors), is about 106, 83, 28, and 26, respectively, so that the rank of the four candidates did not change. On the assumption that the contribution was related to the candidate's position in the order of the coauthors' names, the numbers of papers were corrected to 84, 95, 26, 33 using one statistical method and to 88, 94, 28, 31 using another. These assumptions may not be valid, however, especially as the last author may be more important than the intermediate ones.

The ensuing inflationary and equalizing biases distort derived bibliometric measures of merit by systematically benefiting secondary authors at the expense of primary authors. Here I show how harmonic counting, which allocates credit according to authorship rank and the number of coauthors, provides simultaneous source-level correction for both biases as well as accommodating further decoding of byline information. I also demonstrate large and erratic effects of counting bias on the original h-index, and show how the harmonic version of the h-index provides unbiased bibliometric ranking of scientific merit while retaining the original's essential simplicity, transparency and intended fairness. Harmonic decoding of byline information resolves the conundrum of authorship credit allocation by providing a simple recipe for source-level correction of inflationary and equalizing bias. Harmonic counting could also offer unrivalled accuracy in automated assessments of scientific productivity, impact and achievement.},

Contributed papers demonstrate how altmetrics can work on a personal level to enhance a scholar's CV and on a broad, even global level, to transform scholarly communication through its interaction with open access, digital repositories and research in emerging countries. One article suggests altmetrics should soon be included among mainstream metrics, and other contributions describe specific indicators and altmetric software considerations.

Ten percent of the respondents knew of plagiarism, while 58\% confirmed experience of less severe misconduct, most frequently misleading authorship. Nine percent had themselves contributed to one or more incidents of misconduct. Occurrence of misconduct was not related to area of research. The gap between admitting own misconduct and knowledge of misconduct by others was striking. According to 54\% of the respondents, organized ethical education for young scientists would be an effective way of preventing misconduct.

	abstract = {Plagiarism strikes at the heart of academe, eroding the fundamental value of academic research. Recent evidence suggests that acts of plagiarism and awareness of these acts are on the rise in academia. To address this issue, a vein of research has emerged in recent years exploring plagiarism as an area of academic inquiry. In this new academic subject, case studies and analysis have been one of the most influential methodologies employed. Case studies provide a venue where acts of plagiarism can be discussed and analyzed in a constructive manner, and that is the primary purpose of this article. Unlike previous studies, however, we focus on the role of the publisher, a key player in dealing with acts of plagiarism, but one who has received little attention in the academic literature. Specifically, we examine how an academic publisher addressed allegations of plagiarism and how the publisher's decision-making affected the outcome. We analyze the case by applying the guidelines from different frameworks and ethical theory and develop recommendations from the lessons evidenced, the second main objective of our article. This analysis advances the dialog on academic plagiarism by exploring the role of the publisher from a deontological perspective of ethical absolutism.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT},

Two scientists are considered connected if they have authored a paper together and explicit networks of such connections are constructed by using data drawn from a number of databases, including MEDLINE (biomedical research), the Los Alamos e-Print Archive (physics), and NCSTRL (computer science). I show that these collaboration networks form “small worlds,” in which randomly chosen pairs of scientists are typically separated by only a short path of intermediate acquaintances. I further give results for mean and distribution of numbers of collaborators of authors, demonstrate the presence of clustering in the networks, and highlight a number of apparent differences in the patterns of collaboration between the fields studied.},

	abstract = {Although the field of scientometrics/bibliometrics is rapidly growing, and the interest in scientometric indicators is constantly rising, the field is in a crisis: subfields are drifting apart, the field is lacking consensus in basic questions and of internal communication, the quality of scientometric research is questioned by other disciplines. Among the causes stated are: the loss of integrating personalities; shift from basic and methodological research to applied bibliometrics; domination of the interests of science policy and business in commissioning and funding research; vendor policies and failing quality-management on the side of database- producers; misuse of bibliometric research results and disregard for scientific standards. To overcome the situation, the authors plead for integrative and interdisciplinary research approaches, for reinforcing fundamental, methodological and experimental research prograrr, s in scientometrics, for indpendent funding of research, and for an enhancement of scientometric databases. The need for acknowledged technical and scientific standards in research and publication is stressed. Finally, the establishment of a Code of Etlu'cs for the field of scientometrics is proposed. 1.},

We propose a matrix for the intersection of these two topics of variables studied (producers, artifacts, and concepts of communication) by research questions asked (characterizing scholarly communities, evolution of scholarly communities, evaluation of scholarly contributions, and the diffusion of ideas).

Scientific research is all information consuming as well as producing human activity of which output outperforms its input. The study of characteristics of information processes represents a central topic in the discipline of science and also in Bibliometrics. The channels of information either in the classical printed or in electronic form are the scientific journals, which contain about 70 \% of the new information, produced in natural sciences. Conditions and intensity of the information flow between persons, teams, institutions, countries, etc. have been widely studied.

	title = {Review of '{Citation} analysis in research evaluation'},
	volume = {15},
	abstract = {In 1964 the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) launched its journal impact factor (IF), a quantitative measure that looks at the frequency with which an article in a journal is cited in a particular period (typically the current and the previous calendar year). The basic idea underlying the IF is that articles that are generally considered important for some reason are cited more frequently than other articles. Researchers should have a basic understanding of what an IF is, what it measures, what its strengths and limitations are, and how they can be used in a sensible way to evaluate the quality of research and researchers. Henk Moed's Citation Analysis in Research Evaluation provides a general introduction to these issues. Most importantly, it presents the definition of the IF-a ratio with the number of citations as the numerator, and the number of citable documents as the denominator. The book covers eight themes: assessment of research departments and journals in basic science; construction of the ISI citation indexes; assessment of research performance in the social sciences and humanities; accuracy of the ISI databases; what references and citations actually represent; the relationship between peer review and citation analysis; macro-level issues; and new developments in the field of bibliometrics. The book is written for members of the scholarly research community as a whole (i.e., not just psychologists) as well as those involved in research evaluation and research policy, including research policy makers, members of peer review committees, and those who will be subjected to an assessment of their research performance. Its aim is to provide these readers with a basic insight into the nature of citation analysis, the construction and calculation of its indicators, and their potentialities and limitations, especially with regard to their use in research evaluation. Although stylistically not a masterpiece, Citation Analysis in Research Evaluation is a valuable book for those interested in research evaluation. Its take-home message is that citation analysis is an interesting additional tool for evaluating research, but also that citation counts do not provide a complete, valid, reliable, and unbiased indication of the quality of journals, departments, or researchers within departments. This applies in general, but even stronger in fields that are not well covered by the ISI databases. While one may lament the disappearance of the traditional work and organizational (W/O) psychologist (being half practitioner, half researcher), the trend towards using IF is inevitable and perhaps even part of what may be called the maturation process of W/O psychology. Of course, this is not to say that citation analysis and impact factors should be the sole indicators of research excellence, and Henk Moed's book on this and related issues certainly helps in qualifying the value of these concepts, showing what is currently possible in bibliometrics and what is not.

One of these is a new index that considers both citation and reference counts. We demonstrate this universality for relatively well cited publications from a single institute, grouped by year of publication and by faculty or by department. We show similar behaviour in publications submitted to the arXiv e-print archive, grouped by year of submission and by sub-archive. We also find that for reasonably well cited papers this distribution is well fitted by a lognormal with a variance of around 1.3 which is consistent with the results of Radicchi, Fortunato, and Castellano (2008). Our work demonstrates that comparisons can be made between publications from different disciplines and publication dates, regardless of their citation count and without expensive access to the whole world-wide citation graph. Further, it shows that averages of the logarithm of such relative bibliometric indices deal with the issue of long tails and avoid the need for statistics based on lengthy ranking procedures.},

In addition we show that the same universal behavior occurs when citation distributions of articles published in the same field, but in different years, are compared. These findings provide a strong validation of c(f) as an unbiased indicator for citation performance across disciplines and years.

Ranking papers according to their citations, this index quantifies a researcher only by its greatest possible number of papers that are cited at least h times. A closed formula for h-index distribution that can be applied for distinct databases is not yet known. In fact, to obtain such distribution, the knowledge of citation distribution of the authors and its specificities are required. Instead of dealing with researchers randomly chosen, here we address different groups based on distinct databases. The first group is composed of physicists and biologists, with data extracted from Institute of Scientific Information (ISI). The second group is composed of computer scientists, in which data were extracted from Google-Scholar system. In this paper, we obtain a general formula for the h-index probability density function (pdf) for groups of authors by using generalized exponentials in the context of escort probability. Our analysis includes the use of several statistical methods to estimate the necessary parameters. Also an exhaustive comparison among the possible candidate distributions are used to describe the way the citations are distributed among authors. The h-index pdf should be used to classify groups of researchers from a quantitative point of view, which is meaningfully interesting to eliminate obscure qualitative methods. 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Two different types of self-citations are described: author self-citations (citations received from the author him/herself) and co-author self-citations (citations received from the researchers co-authors but without his/her participation). Self-citations do not play a decisive role in the high citation scores of documents either at the individual or at the meso level, which are mainly due to external citations. At micro-level, the percentage of self-citations does not change by professional rank or age, but differences in the relative weight of author and co-author self-citations have been found. The percentage of co-author self-citations tends to decrease with age and professional rank while the percentage of author self-citations shows the opposite trend. Suppressing author self-citations from citation counts to prevent overblown self-citation practices may result in a higher reduction of citation numbers of old scientists and, particularly, of those in the highest categories.

One strand of the text performs an analysis of citation patterns in SSK. This text identifies the figures who have had the most impact through their articles and books, and examines the possible effects of cultural and linguistic bias. It also investigates the impact of SSK outside the field, asks whether this impact has changed over time, and identifies researchers who have had a particularly high impact outside SSK. The other strand takes citation analysis, as exemplified in the citation study of SSK, as its topic. This text focuses on the way the citation analysis constitutes its field of study, and on the way a citation is produced as a separable, countable category. It notes the `realistic' idea of science categories which is deployed, and the individualistic model of scientific activity. It questions the involvement of citation analysis with power, both in the traditional sense of institutional control of science through funding changes, and in the Foucaldian sense of scientists adopting citation counting as a regime of self-regulation. The paper ends with a dialogue between the `authors' on/in these issues.},

Disregarding problems of organization, construction, \& use or misuse, the classic peer review system is still commonly accepted as a central evaluation system by the science communities \& the university system, \& in the political \& public field. Is it possible to think of other methods or systems for quality assessment or evaluation in science? In private knowledge-based companies, focus is increasingly turned toward the organizational \& social dimensions \& relations surrounding the production of new knowledge.

While the proportion of direct self-citations (including co-authors of both citing and cited papers) is relatively constant in time and across specialties in the natural sciences (10\% of references) and the social sciences (20\%), the same cannot be said for citations to authors who are members of the co-author network. Differences between fields and trends over time lie not only in the degree of co-authorship which defines the large-scale topology of the collaboration network, but also in the referencing practices within a given discipline, computed by defining a propensity to cite at a given distance within the collaboration network. Overall, there is little tendency to cite those nearby in the collaboration network, excluding direct self-citations. These results are interpreted in terms of small-scale structure, field-specific citation practices, and the value of local co-author networks for the production of knowledge and for the accumulation of symbolic capital. Given the various levels of integration between co-authors, our findings shed light on the question of the availability of ‘arm's length’ expert reviewers of grant applications and manuscripts.},

We intend to throw light on the very process of public disclosure of scientific fraud, as it has transformed in the last 30 years within the framework of scientific research institutions. By focusing our analysis on the "denunciation process", we intend to refer to the dual issue of the researcher's individual liability on the one hand and the institutional liability of the structures on the other. Passing from the individual stage, which involves criteria such as the truth of the research, to an institutional stage, which involves common ethical references, the analysis will highlight that the issue of research integrity (the accuracy of an assumption made by the researcher and its actual object) has been replaced by an ethical value more widely shared by the international scientific community. Chapter 3 below will demonstrate that this ethical value can be defined either as "confidence in science as a whole" or "the duty of objectivity relative to freedom of research". The disclosure of scientific fraud is not only a private stage on which an "individual drama" is unfolding, involving the researcher's personal conscience or that of their closer associates; it is a "public stage" where inter-subjective references clash with collective values. This switch from private issue to institutional context has yet to be clarified in the knowledge society; while we know exactly what standards in terms of ethics and deontology are being breached by researchers when they do not comply with truth criteria, the collective institutional values involved in the case of scientific fraud have still to be examined.},

	abstract = {When reporting on the retraction of a study in the Annals of Thoracic Surgery, for example, [Adam Marcus] contacted the journal's editor, Dr. Henry Edmunds. The language of the retraction was vague, which isn't uncommon, and Marcus asked Edmunds to clarify why the study was retracted. There was nothing vague about Edmunds response to Retraction Watch: "That's none of your damn business" (http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2011/01/05/why-was-that-paper-retracted-editor-to-retraction-watch-its-none-of-your-damn-business). Most editors aren't quite as blunt, though many are reluctant to shed light on the reason for a retraction. "Many journal publishers seem to believe we don't need that information," says [Ivan Oransky]. "We find that insulting to science." Of course, not all journals shy away from explaining retractions. In February, for example, the journal Anesthesia \& Analgesia published a lengthy letter describing why 22 papers were retracted (www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/site/misc /25.February.2011.Notice.pdf). According to Dr. Steve Shafer, the journal's editor, a retracted study should not be expunged because that would "burn a hole in the fabric of scientific knowledge," leading only to further damage. "The retraction notice becomes part of the fabric as well," Shafer writes in an email. "The retraction notice must include sufficient information to permit readers to accurately infer exactly why the article has been retracted, and, ideally, how that retraction affects our knowledge."},

	abstract = {Among the most recent bibliometric indicators for normalizing the differences among fields of science in terms of citation behaviour, Kosmulski (J Informetr 5(3):481–485, 2011 ) proposed the NSP (number of successful paper) index. According to the authors, NSP deserves much attention for its great simplicity and immediate meaning—equivalent to those of the h -index—while it has the disadvantage of being prone to manipulation and not very efficient in terms of statistical significance. In the first part of the paper, we introduce the success -index, aimed at reducing the NSP -index’s limitations, although requiring more computing effort. Next, we present a detailed analysis of the success -index from the point of view of its operational properties and a comparison with the h -index’s ones. Particularly interesting is the examination of the success -index scale of measurement, which is much richer than the h -index’s. This makes success -index much more versatile for different types of analysis—e.g., (cross-field) comparisons of the scientific output of (1) individual researchers, (2) researchers with different seniority, (3) research institutions of different size, (4) scientific journals, etc.},

	abstract = {In its second decade, the study of global change will require increased research on the interactions of physical, biological and anthropogenic processes. The absence of prior substantive collaboration across the natural and social sciences has resulted in the delineation of a well-articulated global change research agenda that calls for, but does not yet encompass, significant interdisciplinary collaboration. There are few models of the kind of successful collaboration that is needed, and little concrete evidence of how it should be attempted. This paper makes a distinction between cooperative, but partitioned multidisciplinary research, and collaborative interdisciplinary research. The latter will only be possible if scientists from collaborating fields begin to alter the way they think about global data, and prepare to take the time needed to address the problems.},

	abstract = {From an analysis of papers indexed in three years of Biochemistry and Biophysics Citation Index (1992, 1995 and 1998), it is found that 103 institutions in Israel have published 4,112 papers in more than 990 journals and 64 non-journal sources published from 27 countries. More than 16\% of papers have appeared in journals with an impact factor (IF) higher than 7.00 and an equal fraction of papers have appeared in journals with an IF of less than 1.00. The sum of the IFs of the journals in which papers have been published has been used as a rough measure to quantify each institution's research contribution. Hebrew University, the Weizmann Institute and Tel Aviv University are the institutions publishing the largest number of papers, while Rehovot and Jerusalem are the leading cities. Journal of Biological Chemistry, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences - USA, FEBS Letters and Biochemistry are the journals most often used by Israeli researchers to publish their work. To overcome the problems of conducting world-class research in a small country, Israel uses collaboration with overseas laboratories to great advantage. More than 42\% of papers in the sample involve international collaboration; half of them with laboratories in the USA and some with Germany, France, the UK and Canada. Over 10\% of papers have resulted from domestic collaboration. In general, internationally collaborated papers are published in higher-impact journals, but domestically collaborated papers more often appear in lower-impact journals than single-institution papers. While the USA remains the most important partner of Israel, papers co-authored with French and UK collaborators raise the IF value of Israeli contributions more than those with other partner countries.},

THESE LIMITATIONS HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE DIFFICULTY OF COMPILING \& MANIPULATING MANUALLY THE LARGE AMOUNT OF DATA. THE DATA BASE USED TO PRODUCE SCIENCE CITATION INDEX CAN BE USED AS A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM. SCIENCE CITATION INDEX HAS GROWN FROM 600 JOURNALS IN 1964 TO 2,400 JOURNALS IN 1972 \& IT NOW INCLUDES THE WORLD'S MOST IMPORTANT SCIENTIFIC \& TECHNICAL JOURNALS. THE DATA BASE FROM WHICH THE VOLUMES ARE NOW COMPILED IS PUT ON MAGNETIC TAPE \& UPDATED WEEKLY. THE DATA BASE IS MULTIDISCIPLINARY, COVERS A SUBSTANTIAL PERIOD OF TIME, \& IS AMENABLE TO LARGE MANIPULATION BY COMPUTER. THE INSTITUTE FOR SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION DID A SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS OF JOURNAL CITATION PATTERNS ACROSS THE WHOLE OF SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY IN 1971. ALL REFERENCES PUBLISHED DURING THE LAST QUARTER OF 1969 IN THE 2,200 JOURNALS COVERED BY SCIENCE CITATION INDEX WERE EXTRACTED FROM THE DATA BASE. THE SAMPLE WAS ABOUT 1 MILLION CITATIONS OF JOURNALS, BOOKS, REPORTS, THESES, ETC. THE 3-MONTH SAMPLE WAS TESTED TO SEE IF IT REPRESENTED THE YEAR AS A WHOLE BY MATCHING IT AGAINST ANOTHER SAMPLE MADE BY SELECTING EVERY 27TH REFERENCE FROM 4 MILLION REFERENCES COLLECTED FROM AN ENTIRE YEAR. RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE 3-MONTH DATA DID CONSTITUTE A VALID SAMPLE. 8 FIGURES. B. MILLER.},

	abstract = {The examination of a single scientific manuscript seldom alerts scientists, reviewers, editors, and scientific administrators to the fabrication and falsification of data and information. This review shows that most documented cases of scientific fraud involve falsification (altering truthful information) and fabrication (inventing information where none previously existed). Plagiarism is much less frequent. The review of published accounts also shows that the publication of scientific papers containing recognizable fraudulent material is very low, probably less than 0.02\% and extremely difficult to detect. Because most reported cases of fraud have involved research done at prestigious organizations with distinguished co-authors, and that is published in journals with exacting review processes, it becomes evident that some unscrupulous scientists are adept at fabricating and falsifying data. However, "significant" scientific fraud is detected when scientists repeatedly report results that cannot be independently verified, when colleagues report suspicious behavior, or scientific audits are performed. This review documents and compares many of the better-known cases of scientific fraud. Fraudulent behavior has served as the impetus for the scientific community to develop publication procedures and guidelines that help to guard against not only fraudulent behavior but also against other types of unethical or undesirable behaviors. A companion paper reviews the non-fraudulent issues associated with scientific publication.},

If the National Institutes of Health upholds a finding it made earlier this month that fraud had been committed, there may be another two years of appeals ahead. The reason for the long, labyrinthine process -- there have been two investigations at the university level, two at the N.I.H. and two by Congress -- is that scientists' standards are fundamentally different from those used by the courts. Scientists tend to believe that any inquiry that involves respected citizens of science must prove misconduct not only beyond a reasonable doubt, but, as in their own work in the laboratory, beyond the possibility of an alternate explanation. The assumption is that since science is built on trust it should be left to police itself.

	abstract = {When scientists from two or more disciplines work together on related problems, they often face what we call 'science friction'. As science becomes more data-driven, collaborative, and interdisciplinary, demand increases for interoperability among data, tools, and services. Metadata ― usually viewed simply as 'data about data', describing objects such as books, journal articles, or datasets ― serve key roles in interoperability. Yet we find that metadata may be a source of friction between scientific collaborators, impeding data sharing. We propose an alternative view of metadata, focusing on its role in an ephemeral process of scientific communication, rather than as an enduring outcome or product. We report examples of highly useful, yet ad hoc, incomplete, loosely structured, and mutable, descriptions of data found in our ethnographic studies of several large projects in the environmental sciences. Based on this evidence, we argue that while metadata products can be powerful resources, usually they must be supplemented with metadata processes. Metadata-as-process suggests the very large role of the ad hoc, the incomplete, and the unfinished in everyday scientific work.},

	abstract = {Collaborative, team-based research is now a prevalent mode for conducting fundamental scientific research in many fields. Moreover, collaboration in scientific research is often both trans-organizational and trans-national in nature: that is, collaborations frequently involve researchers based within different organizational entities and located in different countries (Georghiou, 1998; U.S. National Science Foundation, 2002). Public-private research collaborations are one mechanism by which firms can access or create critical knowledge for use in industrial innovation. Facilitating linkages between public research organizations and firms is viewed as a critical mechanism for increasing the efficiency and outputs of national innovation systems (Rosenberg and Nelson, 1993). However, very little is known about how non-domestic firms are involved in collaboration with national public sector research institutions, and the role that these trans-national collaborations play in industrial technology development. This study proposes to address that issue by analyzing a database containing one form of output from public-private research collaborations between U.S. and European union organizations: peer-reviewed scientific and technical publications. This analysis will investigate the following research questions: (1) How prevalent are such collaborations in the international science and technology enterprise, and what are their trends in growth and research configurations; (2) How are such collaborations related to various aspects of technological innovation in firms, such as nature of technology development in particular industries and corporate processes for acquiring and exploiting new scientific knowledge? (3) How does participation in such collaborations relate to firm-level innovation and corporate performance? The following methods are used to conduct the analysis: (1) Identify different patterns in collaboration over successive overlapping timeframes. (2) Using cluster analysis, divide the firms in each industry into different strategic groups based on their patenting output and financial performance. (3) Analyze differences in patterns of participation in collaborations among these groups using t-test of mean values of the dependent variables (after Bierly and Chakrabarty, 1996). The analysis intends to show (a) what patterns in collaboration are found in trans-Atlantic public-private research collaborations; (b) indicator of how firm and industry traits affect collaborative behavior; (c) correlation between patterns in collaboration and R\&D productivity and firm performance.},

	abstract = {Media attention to retracted research suggests that a substantial number of papers are corrupted by misinformation. In reality, every paper contains misinformation; at issue is whether the balance of correct versus incorrect information is acceptable. This paper postulates that analysis of retracted research papers can provide insight into medical misinformation, although retracted papers are not a random sample of incorrect papers. Error is the most common reason for retraction and error may be the principal cause of misinformation as well. Still, one-quarter of retracted papers are fraudulent, and misinformation may also arise through fraud. This paper hypothesises that error and fraud are the main sources of misinformation and that error is more common than fraud. Retraction removes misinformation from the literature; bias is non-retracted misinformation. Bias arises when scientific impropriety results in false research findings. Impropriety can involve experimental design, data collection, data analysis, or data presentation. Yet impropriety also arises through earnest error or statistical naiveté; not all bias is fraud. Several measures are proposed to minimise misinformation in the medical literature, including: greater detail in the clinical trial registry, with rigorous definition of inclusion and exclusion criteria and primary endpoints; clear statistical criteria for every aspect of clinical trials, especially sample size; responsibility for data integrity that accrues to all named authors; increased transparency as to how the costs of research were paid; and greater clarity as to the reasons for retraction. Misinformation can arise without malicious intent; authors of incorrect papers are owed a presumption of incompetence, not malice.},

	abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

This deception by individuals has been fostered by the unrealistic expectations of society; facilitated by the complicity of institutions and organisations; and sanctioned by the inaction of supposed gate-keepers. Re-defining misconduct as occurring on a continuum from irresponsible to fraudulent is the first step in confronting this inconvenient truth. Implementing and evaluating multiple strategies targeting systems and individuals that promote the responsible conduct of research, rather than merely exposing serious instances of misconduct by individuals, is urgently required to restore faith in the aspirations, integrity, and results of scientific research.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses criteria for evaluation of faculty in general as they apply specifically to faculty of schools of library and information science. The criteria considered are those identified in The CALL, the procedures used in faculty personnel actions at University of California, Los Angeles. Among those criteria, that relating to "research and creative work" requires special attention. To provide a benchmark for evaluation, the paper analyzes citation statistics for a total of 411 tenured level faculty (i.e., professor and associate professor ranks) at 60 schools of library and information science with M.L.S. degree programs accredited by the American Library Association. It identifies 40 faculty (about 10\%) with the highest frequency of citation. It provides analyses of the distributions by several subject specialties and for various time periods. It calculates several measures for the ranking of schools in terms of frequency of publication and citation of faculty. It analyzes the relations to Ph.D. degree programs. It compares the resulting rankings with the several subjective rankings of schools, based on surveys of individuals. In making the comparison, it was hypothesized that the "top ten" as identified by Blau and Margulies (1974) 1 would overlap other schools, but that there would be distinct subgroups that did not overlap (those in the group of the "Blau and Margulies" ten and those in the other schools that are significantly below the range of overlap). Such turned out to be the case. The faculty were those identified in the Journal ofEducation for Librarianship, Directory Issue, as appointed to their respective schools during academic year 1979-80. The data are derived from the citation indexes and source indexes as reported in Social Science Citation Index over the 15-year period 1965-80.

Two aspects are classically taken into account: overall productivity and overall diffusion/impact, which can be measured by a plethora of indicators that consider publications and/or citations separately or synthesise these two quantities into a single number (e.g. h-index). A secondary aspect, which is sometimes mentioned in the rules of competitive examinations for research position/promotion, is time regularity of one researcher's scientific output. Despite the fact that it is sometimes invoked, a clear definition of regularity is still lacking. We define it as the ability of generating an active and stable research output over time, in terms of both publications/quantity and citations/diffusion. The goal of this paper is introducing three analysis tools to perform qualitative/quantitative evaluations on the regularity of one scientist's output in a simple and organic way. These tools are respectively (1) the PY/CY diagram, (2) the publication/citation Ferrers diagram and (3) a simplified procedure for comparing the research output of several scientists according to their publication and citation temporal distributions (Borda's ranking). Description of these tools is supported by several examples. Adapted from the source document.},

The nontraditional predictor was power distance, which was manipulated through the collection of data from 184 local managers and professionals in New Zealand, Spain and the USA. The data analyses employed partial least squares-based structural equation modeling, and led to one surprising conclusion: perceived information overload intensity seems to be more strongly related to power distance than to the volume of written information or number of information transactions processed by an individual. This conclusion is referred to here as the information overload paradox. Adapted from the source document.},

	abstract = {In an era of intense interest in educational reform, spurred by increasing global competition for jobs and advancement, it is more critical than ever to understand the nature of learning. And although much attention is paid to differences between learners, short shrift is often given to cognitive functions that characterize successful learning for all students. Yet these are the very functions that determine the difference between successful and rewarding learning versus merely “doing” without truly learning. Firmly grounded in the principles of neuropsychology, Beyond Individual Differences analyzes both successful and unproductive learning in terms of the brain’s organizing processes – that is, its unconscious sifting, selecting, and meaning-making that enable students to incorporate and build on what they’ve learned in the past. At the same time, it explores the learning situations that cause organization to break down and offers several preventive strategies. Key areas of coverage include: The complex role of mental organization in learning and education.Specific organizing processes and the links to success or failure in learning.Information/cognitive overload.The student’s experience of learning and its impact on development. Accommodating a range of individual differences in the classroom.Practices for supporting students’ unconscious organizing processes.Beyond Individual Differences is essential reading for a wide range of professionals and policy makers as well as researchers and graduate students in school and clinical child psychology, special and general education, social work and school counseling, speech therapy, and neuropsychology.},

In this paper, we also advance a new method - Paper Quality Index (PQI) to evaluate the output of a researcher. The main purpose of our method is to solve two problems that consist in the method of h-index: one is that the h-index can't compare the outputs of researchers in different fields; the other is that it is unsuitable for evaluating the outputs of young researchers. A simple mathematical expression is constructed to eliminate the difference of citation among different fields and makes the evaluation of short-term outputs of researchers possible.},

	abstract = {When scientific articles are found to contain fabricated or plagiarized data, or to be invalidated by pervasive error, they are customarily withdrawn from the literature by published retractions. The effect of retraction was studied by citation analysis of 53 retracted biomedical articles. Two research questions were investigated: Does publication of a retraction depress the frequency of subsequent citation? and Are post-retraction citations negative, or are retracted papers cited in order to support or substantiate the assumptions or findings of the citing article? The first question was studied by comparing the number of citations that each article received during the two years before retraction to the number of citations received during the two years following retraction. A statistically significant difference was found between the number of pre-retraction citations (495) and the number of post-retraction citations (303). The difference remained statistically significant even after estimating the decline in citation frequency attributable to obsolescence. The second question was studied by citation context analysis of the 303 residual articles that had cited the retracted publications. The portions of the citing articles that referenced the retracted articles were classified by a subject specialist according to the typology of citation contexts developed by Chubin and Moitra. Citation contexts were found to be affirmative to a statistically significant extent. With ninety percent of the citations being affirmative, the retracted articles were cited as though they were still valid. The citing articles, whose authors were evidently unaware of the published retractions, were written in standard scientific languages; generally originated in the United States, Western Europe, or Scandinavia; and were published in relatively prestigious journals. A content analysis of retraction statements indicated that only 68 percent specified the reason for retraction, 45 percent were published prominently in the journal, and 40 percent identified the individual responsible for the error or misconduct. The continued, affirmative use of retracted articles suggests that some retractions are going unheeded, and that invalid information may be perpetuated through citation in subsequent articles.},

Rio de Janeiro, pp. 798-808, 2009). Ch-index is defined as the number such that, for a general group of scientific publications, ch publications are cited by at least ch different citers while the other publications are cited by no more than ch different citers. The basic difference from the classical h is that, according to ch, the diffusion of one author's publication is evaluated on the basis of the number of different citing authors (or citers), rather than the number of received citations. The goal of this work is to discuss the pros and cons of ch and identify its connection with h. A large sample of scientists in the Quality Engineering/Management field are analyzed so as to investigate the novel indicator's characteristics. Then, the analysis is preliminarily extended to other scientific disciplines. The most important result is that ch is almost insensitive to self-citations and/or citations made by recurrent citers, and it can be profitably used for complementing h.

They also require access to information and mentoring that will help them strategically plan and make informed decisions about their future. Few studies have examined the variables that impact the postdoctoral experience or research productivity. Thus, a comprehensive survey was conducted to determine whether quality supervision, career mentoring, collaboration, networking and a nurturing research environment makes a positive difference in the experiences and productivity of postdoctoral researchers. Unsurprisingly, the survey revealed that job insecurity and lack of a career structure are ongoing concerns for postdocs. However, a clear association was shown between quality supervision, for example, in conveying the importance of taking responsibility for their future academic career by strengthening their track record, and the number of peer-reviewed publications produced. The findings also suggest that mentoring in non-academic career paths can be greatly improved. The results of this study have guided a research-intensive Australian University to implement initiatives and programs which enhance the postdoctoral experience. Finally this work raises awareness of the crucial contributions postdocs make to the research output and environment of universities. Reprinted by permission of Springer},

	abstract = {Faculty research collaboration is a phenomenon that has been quietly growing in popularity. There are indications that this trend will continue especially given the mounting competition for scarce resources and the increasing complexity and scale of the research problems faculty members now investigate. Although this model of scholarly research is widely practiced, we know relatively little about the process, the factors that influence it, and the outcomes. The term itself, "research collaboration," often causes misunderstanding and confusion, as it has multiple meanings.                 This qualitative study uses an open systems conceptual framework to investigate, in-depth, eight research collaboration case studies--four in a disciplinary department and four in a professional school--in a public research university, within the larger context of a changing higher education environment.                 The major findings from this study suggest that research collaborations can be described as process-oriented or results-oriented along a continuum according to: influences, size/scale, focus, and division of labor. The results further indicate that certain personal (e.g., commitment/investment), interpersonal (e.g., mutual trust and respect), and structural elements (e.g., research infrastructure) form the foundation upon which collaborative research is generally fostered and supported. A model for successful collaboration is also provided. Finally, the academy is urged to formally recognize the collaborative knowledge production model as being on par with the traditional sole investigator model of research. The implications for faculty members, for higher education administrators, and for future research on collaboration are discussed.},

Using the 60 members of the Journal of Counseling Psychology editorial board, the authors computed a comparison of 6 popular indices of productivity, revealing considerable levels of positive skewness, kurtosis, and overlap with each other. Combining the strengths of the 6 indices, the authors developed a new productivity index entitled the Integrated Research Productivity Index (IRPI). The IRPI measures individual productivity by statistically combining an individual’s author-weighted publications, average times cited by other publications, and years since first publication into a comprehensive score. Productivity values and IRPI scores for 3 groups of counseling psychologists (Tyler Award recipients, Kuder Award recipients, and Division 17 Presidents) were computed to provide evidence of discriminant validity among the indices. In contrast to the other measures examined, the IRPI accounts for productivity per year and years in the field and assesses mean citation count per article as opposed to total citation count, thus yielding similar scores for Tyler (lifetime) and Kuder (early career) research award recipients.},

A study of 395 articles retracted between 1982 and 2002, Nath et. al. found that 62 percent were retracted due to mistake, while 27 percent as a result of deliberate fabrication or falsification of data and 11\% without a clear reason for retraction. Evidence shows that retracted papers continue to be cited without referring to the retraction. While undertaking a systematic review on post-surgery analgesia, the authors realized that several of the papers determined for possible inclusion belonged to Scott S. Reuben, who was at the time under investigation for using falsified data to write papers. This article examines whether notices of article retractions are recorded in online journals and bibliographic databases in a way that makes it possible for them to be easily identified, even in the absence of a public discussion of retraction. This study had two components: 1. to investigate whether articles written by Reuben that had been retracted at the time of this study were clearly identified as retracted in MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the three databases considered the most important to search to identify reports of randomized controlled trials, and 2. to investigate whether journals that had retracted the papers displayed this information clearly and prominently.

Our research, although at an early stage when this paper was written, suggests that organizational climate may play a significant role in influencing the degree to which human information behaviour moves from being beneficial to the organization to creating overload. We argue that there is a recursive relationship between climate and culture and illustrate our arguments with data from one of our case study organizations: a large multinational bank. Here a climate of mistrust reinforced a culture of "risk avoidance". We describe the antecedents of these elements of the work organization and their influence on information behaviour.

One answer may lie in a still embryonic form of appraisal: the â€œsocial impactâ€ of research.For the benefit of readers who donâ€™t follow the vicissitudes of the research community, the more familiar of these three letter abbreviations, RAE, stands for research assessment exercise: the process by which, until last year, the Higher Education Funding Council of England surveyed the quality of research carried out in British universities. The REF, the research excellence framework,2 is its replacement. In a nutshell, the old system was based principally on peer review of an academic departmentâ€™s research, while the new one will rely far more on metrics: a raft of statistical measures of the research under scrutiny. These could include a departmentâ€™s total non-government research income, the number of its postgraduates, andâ€”worrisome to someâ€”a bibliometric analysis of its research output.Universities take understandable pride in being able to quote good research ratingsâ€”but thereâ€™s more at stake here than academic egos. The assessment figures are used to determine how research funds are allocated.What is good research?One of the pitfalls in any judgment of research is the â€œapples and pearsâ€ problem: like is not being compared with like.

The average impact factor is relatively high and rather constant throughout the period reflecting that the good level of Chilean physics is stable.

	volume = {6},
	abstract = {The purpose of this article is to review and discuss the occurrence of fraud in biomedical research and analyze the definition, origin, and various forms of scientific misconduct. Fraud in research most often involves reporting data for which no records of experiment or population are present; manipulating research materials, equipment, or procedures to arrive at the desirable result; adding, changing, or omitting results, which positively or negatively relate to the hypothesis that the research intends to test; and incorporating ideas, statements, procedures of others' work without permission and appropriate credit to the source. The etiologic factors contributing to this deviant behavior, and measures taken by relevant bodies to eliminate this phenomenon are discussed. Ethical and integrity aspects of craniofacial research are explored and a set of criteria to facilitate rigorous assessment of the integrity of clinical and basic research protocols is proposed. These include (1) an integrity-focused training of researchers to adhere to specific laboratory procedure and tactics which discourage fraud; (2) appointment of external reviewers to detect unusual and suspicious experimental process or data patterns; and (3) encouragement of multicenter trials. Although it is widely recognized that the sole determinant of scientific misconduct is the individual investigator's integrity, a number of precautions may effectively reduce the prevalence of this event, which may affect the status and trends of biomedical research in general.},

	abstract = {Background: Clinical papers so flawed that they are eventually retracted may put patients at risk. Patient risk could arise in a retracted primary study or in any secondary study that draws ideas or inspiration from a primary study. Methods: To determine how many patients were put at risk, we evaluated 788 retracted English-language papers published from 2000 to 2010, describing new research with humans or freshly derived human material. These primary papers -- together with all secondary studies citing them -- were evaluated using ISI Web of Knowledge. Excluded from study were 468 basic science papers not studying fresh human material; 88 reviews presenting older data; 22 case reports; 7 papers retracted for journal error and 23 papers unavailable on Web of Knowledge. Overall, 180 retracted primary papers (22.8\%) met the inclusion criteria. Subjects enrolled and patients treated in 180 primary studies and 851 secondary studies were combined. Results: Retracted papers were cited over 5,000 times, with 93\% of citations being research related, suggesting that ideas promulgated in retracted papers can influence subsequent research. Over 28,000 subjects were enrolled -- and 9,189 patients were treated -- in 180 retracted primary studies. Over 400,000 subjects were enrolled -- and 70,501 patients were treated -- in 851 secondary studies which cited a retracted paper. Papers retracted for fraud (n=70) treated more patients per study (p is less than 0.01) than papers retracted for error (n=110). Conclusions: Many patients are put at risk by retracted studies. These are conservative estimates, as only patients enrolled in published clinical studies were tallied. (edited)},

While authorship historically has been attributed to individuals and small groups, thereby making it relatively easy to tell who made major contributions to the work, recent collaborations have involved hundreds or thousands of individuals. Printing all of these names in the author list on articles can mean difficulties in discerning the nature or extent of individual contributions, which has significant implications for hiring and promotion procedures. This also can make collaborative research less attractive to scientists at the outset of a project. I discuss the issues that physicists are considering as they grapple with what it means to be “an author,” in addition to suggesting that future work in this area draw on the emerging economics literature on “mechanism design” in considering how credit can be attributed in ways that both ensure proper attribution and induce scientists to put forth their best effort.},

	abstract = {We propose two new indices that are able to measure a scientific researcher's overall influence and the level of his/her works’ association with the mainstream research subjects within a scientific field. These two new measures – the total influence index and the mainstream index – differ from traditional performance measures such as the simple citation count and the h-index in that they take into account the indirect influence of an author's work. Indirect influence describes a scientific publication's impact upon subsequent works that do not reference it directly. The two measures capture indirect influence information from the knowledge emanating paths embedded in the citation network of a target scientific field. We take the Hirsch index, data envelopment analysis, and lithium iron phosphate battery technology field to examine the characteristics of these two measures. The results show that the total influence index favors earlier researchers and successfully highlights those researchers who have made crucial contributions to the target scientific field. The mainstream index, in addition to underlining total influence, also spotlights active researchers who enter into a scientific field in a later development stage. In summary, these two new measures are valuable complements to traditional scientific performance measures.},

Using a stratified random sampling strategy, we performed a content analysis of 603 of the 5,393 citing papers to identify indications of awareness that the cited articles affected by scientific misconduct had validity issues, and to examine how the citing papers referred to the affected articles. Fewer than 5\% of citing papers indicated any awareness that the cited article was retracted or named in a finding of misconduct. We also tested the hypothesis that affected articles would have fewer citations than a comparison sample; this was not supported. Most articles affected by misconduct were published in basic science journals, and we found little cause for concern that such articles may have affected clinical equipoise or clinical care.},

From the study of five very old journals of Geology it was noticed that the increase in collaboration and simultaneously decrease in the amount of publication verifies that subject Geology is a quite fully developed field of study.

These tools are respectively (1) the PY/ CY diagram, (2) the publication/citation Ferrers diagram and triad indicators, and (3) a year-by-year comparison of the scientists’ output (Borda's ranking). Results of the regularity analysis are then compared with those obtained under the classical perspective of overall production.

	abstract = {This article introduces the Impact Factor squared or IF2-index, an h-like indicator of research performance. This indicator reflects the degree to which large entities such as countries and/or their states participate in top-level research in a field or subfield. The IF2-index uses the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) of research publications instead of the number of citations. This concept is applied to other h-like indexes and their results compared to the IF2-index. These JIF-based indexes are then used to assess the overall performance of cancer research in Australia and its states over 8 years from 1999 to 2006. The IF2-index has three advantages when evaluating larger research units: firstly, it provides a stable value that does not change over time, reflecting the degree to which a research unit participated in top-level research in a given year; secondly, it can be calculated closely approximating the publication date of yearly datasets; and finally, it provides an additional dimension when a full article-based citation analysis is not feasible. As the index reflects the degree of participation in top-level research it may favor larger units when units of different sizes are compared. Adapted from the source document.},

	abstract = {Information overload is a frequently used term describing a condition apparently agitated by the information age. No comprehensive analysis exists determining even the barest essentials: definitions, parameters, research results, or implications. The purpose of this research effort is to do an in-depth conceptual, citational, and research oriented explication of information overload as the term is used in three selected disciplines: library studies, psychology/psychiatry, and consumer science.                 Searches in the Firstsearch databases of Article1st, Eric, LibraryLit, MedLine, PsychInfo, SocSciAbs, and WilBusAbs with the search term "information overload" identified a set of documents. Weeded out were documents indexed incorrectly, false drops, or documents published before 1960, or after July, 1996. Documents sharing similar perspectives formed researchable discipline specific threads.                 Thread explication is an in-depth synthesis of what is explicit and implicit in the text(s) under consideration. Beginning with the most current document, a tri-level analysis examined definitions and semantics, citation activity and information transfer behaviors, and a discussion of what is implicit in each document. Thread analysis travels backward as citations are followed back to cited sources. Tables of citation figures show common citations through like-minded documents, through the discipline as a whole, and across all three disciplines. Citation frequency counts identify key overload researchers for each discipline and whether the researchers come from within or outside the discipline in question.                 Gathering together the individual thread analyses creates a complete picture of overload literature by a discipline. The three complete overload literatures are then compared and contrasted.                 Emergent patterns reveal citation linkages, citation ranking, within and without of discipline citing behaviors, definition issues, and methodologic and research oriented characteristics. A standard overload formula based on three commonly used variables is identified and discussed. Citation analysis leads to a new cross-discipline key overload researcher list. Additional issues include gender and age, the reason-to-believe syndrome, an element of researcher inter-activity, and a proliferation of medical terminology to claim overload.                 An annotated bibliography of over 200 overload materials from twenty fields of study is appended. Fifty-seven citation tables also are included.},

Preliminary analysis of the data uncovers the three disciplinary foundations as Library and Information Science, Communication, and Information systems. The Bradford distribution reveals that the core of information society journals is not yet fully established. Journal citation and self-citation patterns lend further support for this and help identify which journals are firmly part of the core and which are less so. Finally, research collaboration patterns demonstrate that this area of research is moving towards disciplinary maturity. The paper concludes with some practical and academic recommendations.

Drawing on data from the CD-ROM versions of the , and the from 1980 to 2002, this paper compares collaboration patterns in the SSH to those in the NSE. We show that, contrary to a widely held belief, researchers in the social sciences and the humanities do not form a homogeneous category. In fact, collaborative activities of researchers in the social sciences are more comparable to those of researchers in the NSE than in the humanities. Also, we see that language and geographical proximity influences the choice of collaborators in the SSH, but also in the NSE. This empirical analysis, which sheds a new light on the collaborative activities of researchers in the NSE compared to those in the SSH, may have policy implications as granting councils in these fields have a tendency to imitate programs developed for the NSE, without always taking into account the specificity of the humanities.},

Many surveys have asked scientists directly whether they have committed or know of a colleague who committed research misconduct, but their results appeared difficult to compare and synthesize. This is the first meta-analysis of these surveys. ; To standardize outcomes, the number of respondents who recalled at least one incident of misconduct was calculated for each question, and the analysis was limited to behaviours that distort scientific knowledge: fabrication, falsification, “cooking” of data, etc… Survey questions on plagiarism and other forms of professional misconduct were excluded. The final sample consisted of 21 surveys that were included in the systematic review, and 18 in the meta-analysis. ; A pooled weighted average of 1.97\% (N = 7, 95\%CI: 0.86–4.45) of scientists admitted to have fabricated, falsified or modified data or results at least once –a serious form of misconduct by any standard– and up to 33.7\% admitted other questionable research practices. In surveys asking about the behaviour of colleagues, admission rates were 14.12\% (N = 12, 95\% CI: 9.91–19.72) for falsification, and up to 72\% for other questionable research practices. Meta-regression showed that self reports surveys, surveys using the words “falsification” or “fabrication”, and mailed surveys yielded lower percentages of misconduct. When these factors were controlled for, misconduct was reported more frequently by medical/pharmacological researchers than others. ; Considering that these surveys ask sensitive questions and have other limitations, it appears likely that this is a conservative estimate of the true prevalence of scientific misconduct.},

This paper begins with suggestions for more precise definitions of the terms “responsible conduct of research,” “ research ethics,” and “ research integrity.” It then summarizes the findings presented in some of the more important studies of research behavior, looking first at levels of occurrence and then impact.

Scientific fraud, an act of deception or misrepresentation of one's own work, violates these ethical standards. It can take the form of plagiarism, falsification of data, and irresponsible authorship. Scientific fraud has been attributed to misdirected attempts to attain high levels of personal and professional success. Researchers so prone commit scientific fraud in a search for promotion, status, tenure, and the obtaining of research grants. To divert scientific fraud, three recommendations are suggested: (1) socialize prospective nurse researchers into an atmosphere where intellectual and professional integrity prevail; (2) have established nurse researchers serve as role models and mentors who can educate the neophyte researcher about the ethics of research, including scientific fraud; and (3) emphasize and reward quality in research and publications, rather than quantity.},

	abstract = {SCI has been popular all over the world since it was published by Garfield in 1963. Researches on evaluating a researcher’s output with SCI have always been continuous. In recent years, a great breakthrough has been made since the -index was put forward in 2005. In this paper, we also advance a new method — Paper Quality Index () to evaluate the output of a researcher. The main purpose of our method is to solve two problems that consist in the method of -index: one is that the -index can’t compare the outputs of researchers in different fields; the other is that it is unsuitable for evaluating the outputs of young researchers. A simple mathematical expression is constructed to eliminate the difference of citation among different fields and makes the evaluation of short-term outputs of researchers possible.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the role of homophily and focus constraint in shaping collaborative scientific research. First, homophily structures collaboration when scientists adhere to a norm of exclusivity in selecting similar partners at a higher rate than dissimilar ones. Two dimensions on which similarity between scientists can be assessed are their research specialties and status positions. Second, focus constraint shapes collaboration when connections among scientists depend on opportunities for social contact. Constraint comes in two forms, depending on whether it originates in institutional or geographic space. Institutional constraint refers to the tendency of scientists to select collaborators within rather than across institutional boundaries. Geographic constraint is the principle that, when collaborations span different institutions, they are more likely to involve scientists that are geographically co-located than dispersed. To study homophily and focus constraint, the paper will argue in favour of an idea of collaboration that moves beyond formal co-authorship to include also other forms of informal intellectual exchange that do not translate into the publication of joint work. A community-detection algorithm for formalising this perspective will be proposed and applied to the co-authorship network of the scientists that submitted to the 2001 Research Assessment Exercise in Business and Management in the UK. While results only partially support research-based homophily, they indicate that scientists use status positions for discriminating between potential partners by selecting collaborators from institutions with a rating similar to their own. Strong support is provided in favour of institutional and geographic constraints. Scientists tend to forge intra-institutional collaborations; yet, when they seek collaborators outside their own institutions, they tend to select those who are in geographic proximity. The implications of this analysis for tie creation in joint scientific endeavours are discussed. Adapted from the source document.},

After briefly discussing the evolution of his publication and research scandal in science, I will attempt to outline the main reactions that emerged within scientific and bioethical discourses on the problem of research misconduct in contemporary biosciences. What were the ethical lapses in his research? What kind of research misconduct has been identified? How this kind of misconduct affects scientific integrity? How to avoid it? Focusing on these questions, the paper interprets the Hwang's case as a case study that might shed light on the worst aspects of highstakes global science. This case presents a group of problems that might endanger scientific integrity and public trust. Regulatory oversight, ethical requirements and institutional safeguards are often viewed by the scientific community as merely decelerating scientific progress and causing delays in the application of treatments. The Hwang's case represents how unimpeded progress works in contemporary science. Thus, the case might shed light on the often neglected benefits of "the social control of science".},

Those documents published by researchers affiliated with Harvard University in WoS from 2000-2009, constituted the population of the research which was counted for 124,937 records. Based on the results, only 12\% of Harvard publications were single author publications. Different patterns of collaboration were investigated in different subject fields. In all 22 examined fields, the number of co-authored publications is much higher than single author publications. In fact, more than 60\% of all publications in each field are multi-author publications. Also, the normalized citation per paper for co-authored publications is higher than that of single author publications in all fields. In addition, the largest number of publications in all 22 fields were also published through inter-institutional collaboration and were as a result of collaboration among domestic researchers and not international ones. In general, the results of the study showed that there was a significant positive correlation between the number of authors and the number of citations in Harvard publications. In addition, publications with more number of institutions have received more number of citations, whereas publications with more number of foreign collaborators were not much highly cited.

	abstract = {Information overload is a phenomenon that emerged in the 1990's as the use of information and technology grew exponentially. The purpose of this study was to understand the impact of information overload on managers; to discover strategies that will assist leaders in managing the phenomenon; and to inform theory and practice in the field of human-information interaction. In order to fully understand the problem, the impact of information overload was assessed in a healthcare setting. Five contributing factors identified by Eppler and Mengis (2004) were assessed. They include: (1) the characteristics of the information we are required to process; (2) the types of tasks we perform with the information we receive; (3) the technology we use to assist us in performing those tasks; (4) personal or human factors that help or hinder our ability to manage information; and (5) organizational factors that impact our effectiveness. Data was gathered and promising solutions were identified utilizing a participative action research process. Participants utilized an information overload intensity scale to evaluate the daily impact of information on their lives; reflective journals; and information, task and technology logs to document their daily practices. The data showed information overload impacts managers differently. It was also noted that the role of a manager has changed as they spend more time managing information and technology; and less time managing people. The organizational environment was identified as the leading contributor to information overload. Many solutions to information overload have been recommended in the literature; however, the solutions fall short of solving the problem. The findings of this research suggest organizational information overload must be addressed by taking a systems theory approach to fundamentally rethinking the business practices of our organizations in order to make knowledge work more productive in the 21st Century.

	abstract = {More and more researchers are collaborating with one another across borders and disciplines, creating an influx of information while new technologies are continuing to flood the landscape. Research collaboration can flourish if the outcomes of scientific research are readily available, effortlessly shared and easily remixable. Because of the need to reuse and remix content across the web, there is a growing trend towards open application programming interfaces (APIs). Within the scientific community, the release of APIs by publishers is empowering researchers to shift their adept problem-solving from the lab to powerful web-based platforms that facilitate the creation of customised, domain-specific research tools. Open APIs make it possible for publishers of science, technology and medical (STM) materials to meet customer demands for your data, way through applications that accommodate a variety of workflow needs.

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the nature and negative effects of the "information overload" phenomenon, exacerbated in recent years by organizational design issues and rapid advances in information and communication technology, through a multidisciplinary lens. Design/methodology/approach - Data from a five-country East-West published study of information overload in the Reuters organization are used to examine the influences on information overload and to compare the effects on respondents in each country. Findings - Results of the re-manipulation of the survey data demonstrate significant negative relationships between information overload and the fulfilment of job responsibilities in all five countries surveyed. Information overload was perceived to be most stressful in the USA and UK. Practical implications - Marketing managers face the dilemma of receiving too much information, but too little that is "right" for their planning responsibilities. The challenge is thus to convert "information" into "intelligence" that can effectively support strategic marketing planning. Suggestions are offered for reducing the duplication of information and adopting appropriate information-management strategies. Originality/value - Information overload has serious practical consequences for management and planning in marketing no less than in any other discipline. A clear and comprehensive view of the phenomenon and its effects on everyday job responsibilities is therefore useful in tackling the problem. The cross-national analysis permits adjustments to local management style and behaviour in the major economies of the East and West.},

	title = {The continued use of retracted, invalid scientific literature},
	volume = {Chretien,},
	abstract = {Research fraud, when a scientist intentionally reports data that have been fabricated or altered, has been discovered on numerous occasions in recent years. This phenomenon may result from the pressure on academic researchers to publish frequently; it is known as the "publish or perish" mentality. While the scientific community has debated the causes of research fraud and the appropriate disciplinary measures, little attention has been paid to determining how the invalid data and conclusions are used by other scientists after their publication. In some cases, formal retractions are published by the journal that originally carried the article, but many readers will find the original article without also encountering the retraction. Researchers frequently conduct searches of the literature to gain a background understanding of what other scientists have found on a particular topic. They then conduct their own studies and cite the work of others in their list of references. An analysis of the literature was performed to determine how often authors had cited 82 fraudulent articles that had already been formally retracted. The 82 invalid articles were cited 733 times by other authors who presumably did not know of the retraction. A control group of articles that had not been retracted was compared; this showed that citation of retracted articles was only 35 percent less frequent than citation of valid articles. The continued citation of retracted publications may result in part from the inconsistent procedures used by journals for stating and indexing retractions. Unfortunately the methods used by the scientific community for removing fraudulent literature from use are grossly inadequate at this time; this issue will require further attention.

Public and private agents involved in scientific research in this field in Spain are identified, describing their scientific output and research performance, as well as their relationships at both the national and international level. The methodology used is based on the utilization, on the one hand, of scientist's opinion and, on the other, of bibliometric indicators of scientific output. Opinions of Spanish Earth scientists were obtained through the specially designed survey "Research activities carried out in the R\&D System on Earth Sciences in Spain, 1990-1994". Bibliometric analysis was carried out starting from information on Spanish output contained in three different bibliographic databases: SCI (Science Citation Index), GeoRef (Geological Reference File) and ICYT (Spanish Index on Science and Technology). Furthermore, being the SCI the database is usually used for carrying out bibliometric studies, we determined its suitability as a tool for evaluating Spanish scientific output in Earth Sciences. Finally, we investigated the influence of the present system for the evaluation of the research performance of Spanish scientists, on the research work of Spanish scientists on this field--particularly those directly affected by said evaluation, i.e., those belonging to the University and the Spanish Council for Scientific Research--as well as on the rest of components of the Spanish R\&D System of Earth Sciences.},

The paper begins by assessing contemporary definitions and estimates of scientific misconduct. It emphasizes disagreements over such definitions and estimates as a way to tease out tension and controversy over competing visions of scientific research. It concludes by noting that each narrative suggests a different approach for resolving misconduct, and that the difference inherent in these views may help explain much of the discord concerning unethical behavior in the scientific community.},

Using all the articles published in Web of Science in 2000, we define the degree of interdisciplinarity of a given article as the percentage of its cited references made to journals of other disciplines. We show that although for all disciplines combined there is no clear correlation between the level of interdisciplinarity of articles and their citation rates, there are nonetheless some disciplines in which a higher level of interdisciplinarity is related to a higher citation rates. For other disciplines, citations decline as interdisciplinarity grows. One characteristic is visible in all disciplines: Highly disciplinary and highly interdisciplinary articles have a low scientific impact. This suggests that there might be an optimum of interdisciplinarity beyond which the research is too dispersed to find its niche and under which it is too mainstream to have high impact. Finally, the relationship between interdisciplinarity and scientific impact is highly determined by the citation characteristics of the disciplines involved: Articles citing citation-intensive disciplines are more likely to be cited by those disciplines and, hence, obtain higher citation scores than would articles citing non-citation-intensive disciplines.},

	abstract = {The growth in the production of sci'fic literature has led to various methods for deciding what one should read, such as abstracting services, briefly analyzing the Bibliog of an article, \& more recently, the SCIENCE CITATION INDEX, 1961, 1964 (E. Garfield \& I. Scher, Philadelphia, Pa: Instit for Sci'fic Information, 1963, 1965), which lists all sources cited in papers in a multidisciplinary selection of periodicals. The methods of using the INDEXES are reviewed. Full titles of papers covered are listed in a companion SOURCE INDEX. Among the features found to be most valuable in this method of screening published literature are the fact that citation indexing is essentially an algorithmic process; also, it is selforganizing in nature. It is found that 'statistical regularities discovered in the INDEX point to the existence of certain vague norms of citation behavior.' It is suggested that 'extended use of citation indexing may well lead to general improvement of standards' of choices of material cited. An analysis of a pilot survey of recent papers indicates that articles heavily cited in any one yr continue to be cited a proportionately large N of times in subsequent yrs, but that their survival profile is not very diff from the X. The indirect influence of papers will eventually be measurable in terms of the references cited in an article considered as 'ancestors' of that article, where successive articles which cite that paper are considered as 'descendants.' On the basis of the 2 published INDEXES used, a study of this process was made. Networks of publications can eventually be used in this way to trace the development of major disciplines, fields \& ideas. A method for the estimation of indirect impact in the measurement of sci'fic productivity is outlined for future use. It is noted in conclusion that evaluation by means of citation patterns 'can be successful only insofar as published papers \& their Bibliog's reflect sci'fic activity \& nothing else.' It is noted that publications serve many other purposes, eg, accounting for the time \& money spent in res, etc. Compensations are being made in the form of res carried out in collective projects in large instit's, where publication need not be used for justification. Major journals appear above the army of the journals for a particular discipline. Problems of the `noise' or extraneous information in citation indexing are considered, \& methods are presented for eliminating it, such as increasing the size of the samples on which the reckoning is based. It is felt that this field, with its self-organizing ramifications, deserves close study due to its possible profound effects on the future of sci'fic COMM. A. Heinrich.},

We also report results for 91 administrators charged with overseeing research integrity at the scientists' research institutions. Both groups of respondents were presented with a set of scenarios, designed by fractional factorial methods, describing different kinds of scientific conduct that in the eyes of some would likely be unethical. Respondents then were asked to evaluate each of these scenarios for how unethical the behavior might be and what kinds of sanctions might be appropriate. We use the responses to consider the nature of consensus around norms related to the practice of science and in particular, similarities and differences between scientists and science administrators.

Some current "rules" and conventions for assigning authorship are based on largely unwritten but widely-accepted arbitrary decisions. We hypothesize that the inherent uncertainties about assigning "credit where credit is due" serve as a disincentive for clinicians considering an academic career and may discourage or at least impede the collaborations essential to address most translational and clinical research issues. Surveys of the New England Journal of Medicine and the Annals of Neurology suggest that neurologists have been slow to adopt ways of sharing "credit" appropriately. We recommend that authorship of reports of the primary results of multicenter or multidisciplinary studies should be in the name of the group of investigators collaborating on the work. Given the availability of digital methods that could apportion credit quantitatively, academic leaders, including funding agencies and promotions committees, should consider challenging outmoded authorship conventions.

	abstract = {In the emerging knowledge economy, scientific pursuit in the form of international collaboration has escalated. Studies consistently report that such collaboration, which has been intensifying in the last several decades, is common among not only advanced economies but also in emerging scientific nations such as China, India, and Brazil. The emergence of a " invisible college" of international knowledge exchange has aroused interest from social scientists and captured the attention of policymakers. Indeed, recognizing its importance as a means of monitoring and exploiting other countries' R\&D investment, more and more countries champion and participate in international joint research. International collaboration between the United States (US) and China is particularly interesting. The US has been and will continue to be the leader in scientific development for the foreseeable future. However, as a rising scientific power, China is changing the global landscape of ideas and innovation along with other emerging countries. The growing significance of the US-China relationship and worldwide interest in China's development suggest that the characteristics of the scientific collaboration of these two countries and its associated knowledge dissemination across national borders are timely topics to study. Surprisingly, few studies have examined research collaboration between a scientific superpower and an emerging scientific power, particularly in the context of emerging state-of-the-art technology. This dissertation seeks to address this research gap by examining patterns of collaboration in the US-China scientific community and its impact on China's rapid knowledge accumulation in nanotechnology, if any, through Chinese knowledge moderators (CKMs)--Chinese scholars who bridge two otherwise distant scientific communities through intensive collaboration with both sides. The research focuses on the following three aspects: firstly, built upon the notions of the boundary spanner and the structural hole, the study develops the concept of Chinese knowledge moderators and uses it as an instrument to examine the relationship between international collaboration and knowledge spillover across national boundaries. Secondly, it operationalizes and tests the impact of US-China collaboration using multiple methods. In addition to citation-based indicators, based on the turnover of nanotechnology keywords, the study investigates the impact of collaborating with US scholars on CKMs' research trajectory and the international knowledge spillover facilitated by CKMs. Thirdly, utilizing a longitudinal publication dataset of 77 CKMs and their CV data, this study is able to quantify the dynamic impact of US collaboration on the quality of CKMs' research over time. The combination of bibliometric analyses, empirical testing, and case studies allows for the development of a comprehensive blueprint of US-China scientific collaboration in the field of nanotechnology. This research yields several significant findings. First, the evolution of US-China collaboration in nanotechnology has gone beyond quantitative growth, as qualitative and structural changes have begun to take place. Secondly, CKMs play a critical role in fostering China's nanotechnology development, manifested in both knowledge creation and knowledge diffusion. The present study also reveals that US-China collaboration has a diminishing effect over time on the research quality of CKMs at level of individual papers, but as pertaining to entire journals. Thirdly, the case studies on the evolution of research streams suggest that US-China collaboration influences the research trajectory of CKMs, who, as the conduits of knowledge, further disseminate it within the national boundaries of China. The research also has policy implications for both sides. Chinese policy makers need to strengthen the mechanisms that encourage CKMs collaborating with the US, and, in order to amplify international knowledge spillover, these mechanisms should further encourage more interactions between CKMs and their Chinese domestic colleagues. From the US American perspective, given China's scientific emergence in nanotechnology, the US should direct its efforts to ensuring its ample access to exploiting the heavy R\&D investment of this emerging scientific powerhouse by collaborating with top Chinese scientists.},

This analysis was done for a sample of very highly cited documents in chemistry. A high degree of uniformity is revealed in the association of specific concepts with specific documents. These documents may be seen, in Leach's terms, as 'standard symbols' for particular ideas, methods, and experimental data in chemical science.

	abstract = {Measurement of research activity still remains a controversial question. The use of the impact factor from the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) is quite widespread nowadays to carry out evaluations of all kinds; however, the calculation formula employed by ISI in order to construct its impact factors biases the results in favour of knowledge fields which are better represented in the sample, cite more in average and whose citations are concentrated in the early years of the articles. In the present work, we put forward a theoretical proposal regarding how aggregated normalization should be carried out with these biases, which allows comparing scientific production between fields, institutions and/or authors in a neutral manner. The technical complexity of such work, together with data limitations, lead us to propose some adjustments on the impact factor proposed by ISI which -- although they do not completely solve the problem -- reduce it and allow glimpsing the path towards more neutral evaluations. The proposal is empirically applied to three analysis levels: single journals, knowledge fields and the set of journals from the Journal Citation Report. Adapted from the source document.},

To do this, bibliometric indicators are helpful tools, more and more familiar to research and governmental institutions. This paper proposes a structured method to compare academic research groups within the same discipline, by means of some Hirsch (h) based bibliometric indicators. Precisely, five different typologies of indicators are used so as to depict groups' bibliometric positioning within the scientific community. A specific analysis concerning the Italian researchers in the scientific sector of Production Technology and Manufacturing Systems is developed. The analysis is supported by empirical data and can be extended to research groups associated to other scientific sectors. [Copyright Elsevier B.V.]},

	abstract = {Purpose -- New technologies allow for efficient dissemination of scientific knowledge objects (SKOs). Yet they are likely to transform SKOs as well. The aim of this paper is to propose a way to structure SKOs that allows for both a clear individuation of the main scientific contributions and a fine-grained structure of credits and evaluation. Design/methodology/approach -- The authors review and analyze existing practices of structuring SKOs in different disciplines. Findings -- Provisionally considering the published paper as an atomic SKO, possible subatomic structures of SKOs are investigated. It is hypothesized that SKOs are meant to satisfy two separated but interdependent sets of constraints, one related to the contribution the SKO makes to the body of knowledge, and another related to the contribution the SKO makes to the reputation of its authors. It is hypothesized that existing SKO structures are not optimal for satisfying both sets of constraints at once. Research limitations/implications -- A broader analysis may be needed that covers the totality of existing practices. Practical implications -- Guidelines are offered. This paper, including the present abstract, is an example of what the scientific paper of tomorrow could be like. Social implications -- The paper proposes better apportioning of scientific credits and evaluation; substantive evolution of the academic publishing and credit attribution models. Originality/value -- The idea that the communication and evaluation function of a SKO are differently reflected in their structure is novel. The proposed fine-grained credit attribution system is novel. The molecular/atomic/sub-atomic distinction is a new way to fix the terminology. Adapted from the source document.},

By an author-gated retrieval from ISI's database National Science Indicators on Diskette (NSIOD), of journal articles published by Norwegian scientists involved in microbiological research during the period 1992–1996, a total of 976 microbiological and 938 non-microbiological articles, by 3,486 authors, were obtained. Functional research groups were defined bibliometrically on the basis of co-authorship, yielding a total of 180 research groups varying in size from one author/one article to 180 authors/83 articles (all authors associated with a group during the whole five-year period were included, hence the large group size). Most of Norwegian microbiological research (73\% of the microbiology articles) appears to be performed by specialist groups (with ≥70\% of their production as microbiology), the remainder being published by groups with a broader biomedical research profile (who were responsible for 95\% of the non-microbiological articles). The productivity (articles per capita) showed only moderate (Poisson-distributed) variability between groups, and was remarkably constant across all subfields, at about 0.1 article per author per year. No correlation between group size and productivity was found.},

In a context in which market participants are interested in evaluating the relative individual contribution of authors, it is an equilibrium for papers to use alphabetical ordering. Moreover, it is never an equilibrium for authors always to be listed in order of relative contribution. In fact, we show via an example that the alphabetical name ordering norm may be the unique equilibrium, although multiple equilibria are also possible. Finally, we characterize the welfare properties of the noncooperative equilibrium and show it to produce research of lower quality than is optimal and than would be achieved if coauthors were forced to use name ordering to signal relative contribution.},

	abstract = {Existing guidelines for authorship are lacking in specific detail, differ from discipline to discipline, implicitly or explicitly contradict each other on many issues, and are therefore open to varying interpretation by different people.  In order to encourage and facilitate consistency and fair acknowledgement of contributions to publications, a Points System was developed for evaluating 13 categories of contribution by individuals.  The system is intended for use in determining who should be listed as authors, and in what sequence names should appear by enabling points “earned” through contribution to be then “spent” in purchasing authorship.  The system is based on ratings of perceived values of the contribution types obtained from the staff of a multi-disciplinary research centre, but it can readily be adapted to the local needs and values of any research group.  The system is likely to be particularly useful in relation to complex research projects and programs, to which a number of individuals from different disciplines make contributions over time, and/or from which several publications are derived.

Methods: We retrieved all available Medline retractions from 2005 to 2008 and a one-in-three random selection of those from 1988 to 2004. This yielded 312 retractions (from a total of 870). Details of the retraction including the reason for retraction were recorded by two investigators. Results: Medline retractions have increased sharply since 1980 and currently represent 0.02\% of included articles. Retractions were issued by authors (63\%), editors (21\%), journals (6\%), publishers (2\%) and institutions (1\%). Reasons for retraction included honest error or nonreplicable findings (40\%), research misconduct (28\%), redundant publication (17\%) and unstated/unclear (5\%). Some of the stated reasons might have been addressed by corrections. Conclusions: Journals' retraction practices are not uniform. Some retractions fail to state the reason, and therefore fail to distinguish error from misconduct. We have used our findings to inform guidelines on retractions. (edited)},

This has become known as the information overload effect. Business researchers have generalized this effect to the business deci sion-making domain. Iselin [2] found in a highly structured decision-making task that the magnitude of the information overload effect varied with the diversity of the information. The information diversity in a set of cues was defined as the number of dimensions (unrelated vanables) in the set. It was found that the higher the information diversity, the larger was the information overload effect. The major objective of the research in this paper was to test if this information diversity effect generalized to unstructured decision-making tasks. Con sequently in an experiment, information diversity was manipu lated in an information overload situation in an unstructured managenal decision-making task. Two other independent vari ables studied were task learning and decision experience. The dependent vanable, decision performance, was operationalized to profit and decision time. The results from the experiment showed that increasing information diversity increased the information overload effect on decision time, i.e. decision time increased. This effect was hypothesized. However, information diversity did not affect profit. The hypothesized effects for learning and expenence were largely supported In general, high expenence and learning both resulted in higher decision performance. The experiment revealed a number of interac tions between the variables. The implications of these findings for practice and future research were considered.},

However, there is also a danger of sharing too much information, leading to information overload. The results position information sharing at the heart of SCM; information sharing is enabled by electronic communication media and supply chain systems. In turn, information sharing facilitates closer supply chain relationships. The paper concludes with implications of information sharing and information overload for supply chain practitioners and researchers, as well as an information overload research agenda.},

After discussing the funding effect in science, the paper argues that, like ghost writing and fabricated credentials, conflicts of interest can bias the outcome of research.

By further exploring the method upon a profound evidence-based reflection of actual phenomena, this paper also proposes an exploratory analysis to manage and evaluate research projects upon their differentiated classification in a preceding perspective of research collaboration and R\&D management. In addition, the results show that international collaboration tends to be associated with more evenly committed collaboration, and that collaboration featuring a higher degree of funding or dispersed commitments generally results in larger outcomes than research clustered on the opposite side of the framework.

The procedure is illustrated by elaboration of the macro implications of one aspect of small-scale interaction: the strength of dyadic ties. It is argued that the degree of overlap of two individuals' friendship networks varies directly with the strength of their tie to one another. The impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility opportunity, and community organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly, with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to small, well-defined groups. Emphasis on weak ties lends itself to discussion of relations between groups and to analysis of segments of social structure not easily defined in terms of primary groups.},

The main objective of this paper is twofold, namely first to analyse if the number or weight of actors in scientific communication has increased, if patterns of documented scientific communication and collaboration have changed in the last two decades and if these tendencies have inflationary features. The second question is concerned with the role of scientific collaboration in this context. In particular, the question will be answered to what extent co-authorship and publication activity, on one hand, and co-authorship and citation impact, on the other hand, do interact. The answers found to these questions have strong implication for the application of bibliometric indicators in research evaluation, moreover, the construction of indicators applied to trend analyses and studies based on medium-term or long-term observations have to be reconsidered to guarantee the validity of conclusions drawn from bibliometric results.

	abstract = {This phenomenological study was an exploration of information overload and how it influenced middle management decision-making in a single organization. In-depth interviews were used to gather lived experiences of 22 middle managers at XYZ Defense Company in California. Data were analyzed using both HyperRESEARCH TM 2.8 software and a manual approach described by van Kaam and later modified by Moustakas (1994). The information flow in the organization studied required middle managers to handle volumes of email from both superiors and subordinates and created information overload. Middle manager decision-making relied primarily on e-mail rather than face-to-face communication, creating adverse affects on the organization. Filtering e-mails and multitasking to cope with the overload caused middle managers to ignore or delay decisions. Technology information overload induced stress and led to ineffective decision-making. A bureaucratic style of leadership resulted in a "faceless organization" with middle managers acting as "traffic cops" responsible for filtering vast amounts of information. It is recommended that organizations prepare leaders to deal with the burden of technology information overload and promote better organizational decision-making.},

Publications and citations play a key role in this task, and many previous studies have proposed using measurements based on them for evaluating researchers. Machine learning techniques as a way of enhancing the evaluating process have been relatively unexplored. We propose using a machine learning approach for evaluating researchers. In particular, the proposed method combines the outputs of three learning techniques (logistics regression, decision trees, and artificial neural networks) to obtain a unified prediction with improved accuracy. We conducted several experiments to evaluate the model's ability to: (a) classify researchers in the field of artificial intelligence as Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) fellows and (b) predict the next AAAI fellowship winners. We show that both our classification and prediction methods are more accurate than are previous measurement methods, and reach a precision rate of 96\% and a recall of 92\%.},

	volume = {Chretien,},
	abstract = {CONTEXT: The professional integrity of scientists is important to society as a whole and particularly to disciplines such as medicine that depend heavily on scientific advances for their progress. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the professional norms of active scientists and compare them with those of individuals with institutional responsibility for the conduct of research. DESIGN: A mailed survey consisting of 12 scenarios in 4 domains of research ethics. Respondents were asked whether an act was unethical and, if so, the degree to which they considered it unethical and to select responses and punishments for the act. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 924 National Science Foundation research grantees in 1993 or 1994 in molecular or cellular biology and 140 representatives from the researchers' institutions to the US Department of Health and Human Services Office of Research Integrity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Percentage of respondents considering an act unethical and the mean malfeasance rating on a scale of 1 to 10. RESULTS: A total of 606 research grantees and 91 institutional representatives responded to the survey (response rate of 69\% of those who could be contacted). Respondents reported a hierarchy of unethical research behaviors. The mean malfeasance rating was unrelated to the characteristics of the investigator performing the hypothetical act or to its consequences. Fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism received malfeasance ratings higher than 8.6, and virtually all thought they were unethical. Deliberately misleading statements about a paper or failure to give proper attribution received ratings between 7 and 8. Sloppiness, oversights, conflicts of interest, and failure to share were less serious still, receiving malfeasance ratings between 5 and 6. Institutional representatives proposed more and different interventions and punishments than the scientists. CONCLUSIONS: Surveyed scientists and institutional representatives had strong and similar norms of professional behavior, but differed in their approaches to an unethical act.},

	title = {Research integrity and misconduct: a clarification of the concepts},
	volume = {29},
	abstract = {The commercialization of research and the ever changing scientific environment has led scholars to shift the focus from promoting research integrity to regulating misconduct. As a result, most literature explains research integrity in terms of avoidance of misconduct. The purpose of the paper is to stimulate reflection and discussion on research integrity and research misconduct. This article explores the meaning of research integrity and research misconduct, and how research integrity can be promoted to ensure safer research and scholarship. We believe that the discussion can help clarify some hazy areas in the research and publication processes, and appreciate some crucial aspects that they may have seen taken for granted. The purpose of this article is to share with the readers some clarification or analysis of the two concepts namely: research integrity and misconduct. The objectives are: (1) To explore and analyse the concepts of research integrity and research misconduct from the educational or developmental perspective and not the legal perspective as others in literature have done. (2) To stimulate the reflection and discussion on strategies to promote research integrity and thus prevent research misconduct Literature review and concept analysis was undertaken to clarify the two concepts. We argue that the two concepts can be viewed along a continuum, i.e. where research integrity ends, research misconduct starts. We also argue that it is the responsibility of the research community at large to always ensure that the scientific ethics balance is maintained throughout the research process to ensure research integrity and avoid research misconduct. We also argue that research integrity is interlinked with morality while misconduct is interlinked with immorality.},

Results: Journal IF was higher for fraudulent papers. Roughly 53\% of fraudulent papers were written by a first author who had written other retracted papers ('repeat offender'), whereas only 18\% of erroneous papers were written by a repeat offender. Fraudulent papers had more authors and were retracted more slowly than erroneous papers. Surprisingly, there was significantly more fraud than error among retracted papers from the U.S.A. compared with the rest of the world. (edited)},

Objective.-To examine publications identified in the biomedical literature as having been retracted, to ascertain why and by whom the publications were retracted and to what extent citations of later-retracted articles continue to be incorporated in subsequent work. Design.-A search of MEDLINE from 1966 through August 1997 for articles that had been retracted. Main Outcome Measures.-Characteristics of retractions and citations to articles after retraction. Results.-A total of 235 articles had been retracted. Error was acknowledged in relation to 91 articles; results could not be replicated in 38; misconduct was evident in 86; and no clear reason was given in 20. Of the 235 articles, 190 were retracted by some or all of the authors; 45 were retracted by a person or organization other than the author(s). The 235 retracted articles were cited 2034 times after the retraction notice. Examination of 299 of those citations reveals that in only 19 instances was the retraction noted; the remaining 280 citations treated the retracted article either explicitly (n = 17) or implicitly (n = 263) as though it were valid research. Conclusion.-Retracted articles continue to be cited as valid work in the biomedical literature after publication of the retraction; these citations signal potential problems for biomedical science.},

En se fondant sur les recherches menées au sujet de l'économie de la maison individuelle, il s'agit de construire une théorie économique plus respectueuse de la logique pratique des agents, intégrant les conditions économiques et sociales de la genèse des dispositions économiques. Cela nécessite de concevoir le « marché » que présuppose le plus souvent l'orthodoxie économique comme le produit d'une construction sociale. Le champ économique est un univers régi par des lois spécifiques, résultant d'un processus de différenciation historique, parmi lesquelles en premier lieu la poursuite de l'intérêt proprement matériel. Contrairement à ce qu'implique une vision mécaniste, les agents économiques font exister le champ comme champ de forces en déformant, à des degrés variables, leur voisinage, comme dans la physique einsteinienne. Le principe des actions économiques et les marges de liberté des agents sont à chercher - conformément aux enseignements de la tradition de Harvard - dans la structure du champ, c'est-à-dire dans la structure de la distribution des différents capitaux et dans les rapports de forces corrélatifs, qui ne se réduisent ni à des interactions ni à des ajustements mécaniques. Le champ économique est un champ de luttes où les prix sont des enjeux et des armes dans les stratégies des entreprises (explicitées par les théories du management), qui dépendent de la structure du champ et en particulier des rapports de domination qui le caractérisent. Le capital technologique joue un rôle important dans la subversion des hiérarchies établies, notamment en portant à la redéfinition des frontières entre les champs. Mais les entreprises elles-mêmes sont le lieu de luttes qui contribuent à la détermination de leurs stratégies, celles-ci dépendant à la fois de la structure de la distribution du capital entre les dirigeants et de la position de l'entreprise dans le champ. Les stratégies d'une entreprise dépendent aussi étroitement des relations d'homologie qui s'établissent entre sa position dans le champ de production et celle de ses clients dans l'espace social, ce qui fait de la compétition économique un conflit destructeur mais indirect.},

The main result of the study is that the altmetrics source that provides the most metrics is Mendeley, with metrics on readerships for 62.6 \% of all the publications studied, other sources only provide marginal information. In terms of relation with citations, a moderate spearman correlation (r = 0.49) has been found between Mendeley readership counts and citation indicators. Other possibilities and limitations of these indicators are discussed and future research lines are outlined.},

	abstract = {Despite attempts at clear direction in international, national and journal guidelines, attribution of authorship can be a confusing area for both new and established researchers. As journal articles are valuable intellectual property, authorship can be hotly contested. Individual authors' responsibilities for the integrity of article content have not been well explored. Semi-structured interviews (n = 17) were conducted with staff, student advocates and doctoral candidates working in health research in two universities in Australia. Stratified sampling ensured participants reflected a range of experience across biomedical, clinical and social science disciplines. Participants were asked about their experience with research publication and their views on the responsibilities of authorship. Participants gave a variety of reasons for attribution of authorship including: writing the paper; seniority; and student supervision. Gift authorship was seen by some participants as: a way of maintaining relationships; a reward; a means to increase a paper's credibility; or a demonstration of collaboration between authors. Norms and beliefs differed markedly between disciplines for authorship attribution and, to a lesser extent, for authors' responsibility for content integrity. Discussions about the effect of power differentials on authorship were common across disciplines. This paper describes a broad range of beliefs, values and practice norms held by health science researchers with respect to attribution of authorship and author responsibility for scientific publications. The findings support the need for clarity in relation to authorship, and a research environment which is supportive of ethical behaviour in the publication of research. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {To improve identification of contributors to manuscripts, editors of medical journals have developed authorship responsibility criteria. Some have specified an acceptable number of authors per manuscript. We wanted to examine changes in patterns of authorship in the context of the development of these specifications. Therefore, we used a retrospective cohort design to calculate the average number of authors per manuscript and the prevalence of group and corporate authorship between 1980 and 2000 for original, scientific, non-serial articles published in four prestigious medical journals: the Annals of Internal Medicine, Archives of Internal Medicine, Journal of the American Medical Association, and the New England Journal of Medicine. Group authorship identifies individual authors in the byline who are writing for a group; in corporate authorship, contributors are not individually listed in the byline.We found that the number of authors per article increased dramatically over time in each journal, from an average of 4.5 in 1980 to 6.9 in 2000 across journals. As a proportion of published manuscripts, group authorship (authors listed in the byline) increased from virtually zero to over 15\%, while corporate authorship (authors not listed in the byline) remained rare and stagnant. Manuscripts published by single authors all but vanished. Group authorship was most prevalent in journals that limited the acceptable number of authors per manuscript.These findings suggest that the number of authors per manuscript continues to grow. The growth in the number of authors on bylines and the proportion of group-authored manuscripts is likely to reflect the increasing complexity of medical research. Copyright (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd},

These guidelines include directions on how authorship should be negotiated and allocated and how short-term researchers can begin to develop as authors.  They also deal with the structures required to support an equitable system, which deals with the needs of short-term researchers in ways that are realistic in the increasingly competitive world of research funding and publication, and may offer a model for more formal guidelines that could form part of institutional research policy.

	abstract = {The TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) Talks website hosts video recordings of various experts, celebrities, academics, and others who discuss their topics of expertise. Funded by advertising and members but provided free online, TED Talks have been viewed over a billion times and are a science communication phenomenon. Although the organization has been derided for its populist slant and emphasis on entertainment value, no previous research has assessed audience reactions in order to determine the degree to which presenter characteristics and platform affect the reception of a video. This article addresses this issue via a content analysis of comments left on both the TED website and the YouTube platform (on which TED Talks videos are also posted). It was found that commenters were more likely to discuss the characteristics of a presenter on YouTube, whereas commenters tended to engage with the talk content on the TED website. In addition, people tended to be more emotional when the speaker was a woman (by leaving comments that were either positive or negative). The results can inform future efforts to popularize science amongst the public, as well as to provide insights for those looking to disseminate information via Internet videos.},

This study analyses the order of authorship in the scientific output of 1,064 permanent scientists at the Spanish CSIC (WoS, 1994-2004). The influence of age, professional rank and bibliometric profile of scientists over the position of their names in the byline of publications is explored in three different research areas: Biology and Biomedicine, Materials Science and Natural Resources. There is a strong trend for signatures of younger researchers and those in the lower professional ranks to appear in the first position (junior signing pattern), while more veteran or highly-ranked ones, who tend to play supervisory functions in research, are proportionally more likely to sign in the last position (senior signing pattern). Professional rank and age have an effect on authorship order in the three fields analysed, but there are inter-field differences. Authorship patterns are especially marked in the most collaboration-intensive field (i.e. Biology and Biomedicine), where professional rank seems to be more significant than age in determining the role of scientists in research as seen through their authorship patterns, while age has a more significant effect in the least collaboration-intensive field (Natural Resources).},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether editorial policies designed to eliminate gratuitous authorship (globally referred to as authorship limitation policies), including author contribution disclosures and/or numeric restrictions, have significantly affected authorship trends during a 20-year period. METHODS: We used a custom PERL-based algorithm to extract data, including number of authors, publication date, and article subtype, from articles published from January 1, 1986, through December 31, 2006, in 16 medical journals (8 with explicit authorship guidelines restricting authorship and 8 without formal authorship policies), comprising 307,190 articles. Trends in the mean number of authors per article, sorted by journal type, article subtype, and presence of authorship limitations, were determined using Sen's slope analysis and compared using analysis of variance and matched-pair analysis. Trend data were compared among the journals that had implemented 1 or both of these formal restrictive authorship policies and those that had not in order to determine their effect on authorship over time. RESULTS: The number of authors per article has been increasing among all journals at a mean SD rate of 0.0760.057 authors per article per year. No significant differences in authorship rate were observed between journals with and without authorship limits before enforcement (F=1.097; P=.30). After enforcement, no significant change in authorship rates was observed (matched pair: F=0.425; P=.79). CONCLUSION: Implementation of authorship limitation policies does not slow the trend of increasing numbers of authors per article over time.},

	abstract = {Objectives We explored how readers interpret authors' roles based on authorship order and corresponding author. Study Design and Setting We conducted a cross-sectional survey of all 291 Surgical and Medical Chairpersons across North America. We developed hypothetical study and authorship bylines with five authors varying the corresponding author as first or last author. Respondents reported their perceptions about the authors' roles in the study and the most prestigious authorship position. We used multinomial regression to explore the results. Results One hundred sixty-five chairpersons (response rate: 57\%) completed our survey. When the first author was designated as corresponding author, most of the respondents assumed that this author had taken the lead in study design (55.3\%) and analysis and interpretation of data (51.2\%). When the last author (fifth) was designated as corresponding, perceptions of the first author's role in study concept and design (odds ratio [OR] = 0.25, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.15, 0.41) and analysis and interpretation of results (OR = 0.22, 95\% CI: 0.13, 0.38) decreased significantly. Overall prestige of the last author position increased significantly when designated as corresponding author (OR = 4.0, 95\% CI: 2.4, 6.4). Conclusions Academic department chairs' perception of authors' contributions was influenced by corresponding author designation. Without authors' explicit contributions in research articles, many readers may draw false conclusions about author credit and accountability.},

	abstract = {Research teams are the fundamental social unit of science, and yet there is currently no model that describes their basic property: size. In most fields, teams have grown significantly in recent decades. We show that this is partly due to the change in the character of team size distribution. We explain these changes with a comprehensive yet straightforward model of how teams of different sizes emerge and grow. This model accurately reproduces the evolution of empirical team size distribution over the period of 50 y. The modeling reveals that there are two modes of knowledge production. The first and more fundamental mode employs relatively small, “core” teams. Core teams form by a Poisson process and produce a Poisson distribution of team sizes in which larger teams are exceedingly rare. The second mode employs “extended” teams, which started as core teams, but subsequently accumulated new members proportional to the past productivity of their members. Given time, this mode gives rise to a power-law tail of large teams (10–1,000 members), which features in many fields today. Based on this model, we construct an analytical functional form that allows the contribution of different modes of authorship to be determined directly from the data and is applicable to any field. The model also offers a solid foundation for studying other social aspects of science, such as productivity and collaboration.},

Correct authorship of medical papers is also important because the research and publication process relies on trust. If scientists or clinicians are prepared to lie about who was involved with a research project why should we believe their findings? Groups of journal editors, notably the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, have tried to establish criteria for authorship but these are not universally accepted. Despite the lack of agreement, authorship of journal articles continues to be the basis for academic appointments and is used to measure the research output of departments and therefore determine future funding. Some journals have started to use contributor lists, indicating the role of each individual, in place of, or in addition to, traditional lists of authors. However, problems about the threshold of involvement that merits authorship, and the order of listing remain unresolved. Journal editors are usually unable to adjudicate on authorship disputes since detailed, local knowledge is required. Institutions might therefore play a greater role in setting and enforcing authorship policies. Disputes could be reduced if authorship criteria were agreed, in writing, among all contributors at the start of a research project.},

	abstract = {Leaders are important for scientific groups. Authors of a research paper whose names are listed in the byline first, last, or as the corresponding author are often considered particularly important to that paper. The authorship preferences of scientific group leaders are examined for seven research fields and 11 geographic locations. There are some similarities and differences among research fields and geographic locations in listing group leaders. In the fields of 'Mathematics' and 'Physics, Particles \& Fields', although the custom is for papers to list authors alphabetically, scientific group leaders from Egypt and Shanghai typically list their names first or last in the byline, the same as group leaders in other research fields. Opposite to the group leaders from other locations, leaders from Egypt often appear as the first authors. Scientific group leaders who are listed first in the byline typically also serve as the corresponding authors. For group leaders who are listed last in the byline, the proportion also serving as corresponding authors changes significantly. Accordingly, the proportion of papers in which group leaders are corresponding authors varies considerably among different research fields and geographic locations. The meaning of authorship for research group leaders is discussed in the end from the perspective of their roles in paper production. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Technol. Manage. 22 (7-8) (2001) 636]. Our study focuses on one particular means by which scientists acquire and deploy S\&T human capital, research collaboration. We examine data from 451 scientists and engineers at academic research centers in the United States. The chief focus is on scientists' collaboration choices and strategies. Since we are particularly interested in S\&T human capital, we pay special attention to strategies that involve mentoring graduate students and junior faculty and to collaborating with women. We also examine collaboration "cosmopolitanism," the extent to which scientists collaborate with those around them (one's research group, one's university) as opposed to those more distant in geography or institutional setting (other universities, researchers in industry, researchers in other nations). Our findings indicate that those who pursue a "mentor" collaboration strategy are likely to be tenured; to collaborate with women; and to have a favorable view about industry and research on industrial applications. Regarding the number of reported collaborators, those who have larger grants have more collaborators. With respect to the percentage of female collaborators, we found, not surprisingly, that female scientists have a somewhat higher percentage (36\%) of female collaborators, than males have (24\%). There are great differences, however, according to rank, with non-tenure track females having 84\% of their collaborations with females. Regarding collaboration cosmopolitanism, we find that most researchers are not particularly cosmopolitan in their selection of collaborators-they tend to work with the people in their own work group. More cosmopolitan collaborators tend have large grants. A major policy implication is that there is great variance in the extent to which collaborations seem to enhance or generate S\&T human capital. Not all collaborations are equal with respect to their "public goods" implications. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Explanations for women's underrepresentation in math-intensive fields of science often focus on sex discrimination in grant and manuscript reviewing, interviewing, and hiring. Claims that women scientists suffer discrimination in these arenas rest on a set of studies undergirding policies and programs aimed at remediation. More recent and robust empiricism, however, fails to support assertions of discrimination in these domains. To better understand women's underrepresentation in math-intensive fields and its causes, we reprise claims of discrimination and their evidentiary bases. Based on a review of the past 20 y of data, we suggest that some of these claims are no longer valid and, if uncritically accepted as current causes of women's lack of progress, can delay or prevent understanding of contemporary determinants of women's underrepresentation. We conclude that differential gendered outcomes in the real world result from differences in resources attributable to choices, whether free or constrained, and that such choices could be influenced and better informed through education if resources were so directed. Thus, the ongoing focus on sex discrimination in reviewing, interviewing, and hiring represents costly, misplaced effort: Society is engaged in the present in solving problems of the past, rather than in addressing meaningful limitations deterring women's participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers today. Addressing today's causes of underrepresentation requires focusing on education and policy changes that will make institutions responsive to differing biological realities of the sexes. Finally, we suggest potential avenues of intervention to increase gender fairness that accord with current, as opposed to historical, findings.},

	abstract = {Contemporary biomedical research is performed by increasingly large teams. As a consequence, an increasingly large number of individuals are being listed as authors in the byline of biomedical articles, which complicates the proper attribution of credit and responsibility to individual authors for their work. Typically, more importance is given to the first and last authors of biomedical papers, and the others (the middle authors) are considered to have made smaller contributions. However, we argue that this distinction between first, middle and last authors does not properly reflect the actual division of labor and does not allow a fair allocation of credit among the members of the research teams. In this paper, we use partial alphabetical authorship to divide the authors of all biomedical articles in the Web of Science published over the 1980-2015 period in three groups: primary authors, middle authors, and supervisory authors. We show that alphabetical ordering of middle authors is frequent in biomedical research, and that the prevalence of this practice is positively correlated with the number of authors in the bylines. We also find that, for articles with 7 or more authors, the average proportion of team members in each group is independent of the team size, more than half of the authors being middle authors. This suggests that growth in authors' lists are not due to an increase in secondary contributions but, rather, in equivalent increases of all types of roles and contributions. Nevertheless, we show that the relative contribution of middle authors to the overall production of knowledge in the biomedical field as increased dramatically over the last 35 years.},

However, the share of scientific output published in the journals of these major publishers, as well as its evolution over time and across various disciplines, has not yet been analyzed. This paper provides such analysis, based on 45 million documents indexed in the Web of Science over the period 1973-2013. It shows that in both natural and medical sciences (NMS) and social sciences and humanities (SSH), Reed-Elsevier, Wiley-Blackwell, Springer, and Taylor \& Francis increased their share of the published output, especially since the advent of the digital era (mid-1990s). Combined, the top five most prolific publishers account for more than 50\% of all papers published in 2013. Disciplines of the social sciences have the highest level of concentration (70\% of papers from the top five publishers), while the humanities have remained relatively independent (20\% from top five publishers). NMS disciplines are in between, mainly because of the strength of their scientific societies, such as the ACS in chemistry or APS in physics. The paper also examines the migration of journals between small and big publishing houses and explores the effect of publisher change on citation impact. It concludes with a discussion on the economics of scholarly publishing.},

Researchers are accountable for selecting their collaboration modes, a decision made through strategic decision making influenced by their environments and the trade-offs among alternatives. In this context, by using bibliographic information and related internal data from the Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials (KIMM, a representative Korean government institute of mechanical research), this paper examines the suggested yet unproven determinants of research collaboration modes that the SCI data set cannot reveal through a Multinomial Probit Model. The results indicate that informal communication, cultural proximity, academic excellence, external fund inspiration, and technology development levels play significant roles in the determination of specific collaboration modes, such as sole research, internal collaboration, domestic collaboration, and international collaboration. This paper refines collaboration mode studies by describing the actual collaboration phenomenon as it occurs in research institutes and the motivations prompting research collaboration, allowing research mangers to encourage researchers to collaborate in an appropriate decision-making context.

	abstract = {University patenting has been heralded as a symbol of changing relations between universities and their social environments. The Bayh–Dole Act of 1980 in the USA was eagerly promoted by the OECD as a recipe for the commercialization of university research, and the law was imitated by a number of national governments. However, since the 2000s university patenting in the most advanced economies has been on the decline both as a percentage and in absolute terms. In addition to possible saturation effects and institutional learning, we suggest that the institutional incentives for university patenting have disappeared with the new regime of university ranking. Patents and spin-offs are not counted in university rankings. In the new arrangements of university–industry–government relations, universities have become very responsive to changes in their relevant environments.},

Methodology We quantify the impact of information flow across fields using two large citation dataset: one spanning over a century of scholarly work in the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities, and second spanning a quarter century of United States patents.  Conclusions We find that a publication's citing across disciplines is tied to its subsequent impact. In the case of patents and natural science publications, those that are cited at least once are cited slightly more when they draw on research outside of their area. In contrast, in the social sciences, citing within one's own field tends to be positively correlated with impact.},

It is therefore important for the future of scientific practice to reflect upon the individual scientist’s ethical responsibilities within teams. To facilitate this reflection we show labor force trends in the US revealing a skewed growth in academic ranks and increased levels of competition for promotion within the system; we analyze teaming trends across disciplines and national borders demonstrating why it is becoming difficult to distribute credit and to avoid conflicts of interest; and we use more than a century of Nobel prize data to show how science is outgrowing its old institutions of singleton awards. Of particular concern within the large team environment is the weakening of the mentor–mentee relation, which undermines the cultivation of virtue ethics across scientific generations. These trends and emerging organizational complexities call for a universal set of behavioral norms that transcend team heterogeneity and hierarchy. To this end, our expository analysis provides a survey of ethical issues in team settings to inform science ethics education and science policy.},

They have in common a process of enrolment, by which diverse interests are incorporated textually to support a claim. But the evaluation of a patent draws on different assumptions about the nature of a claim, the relation to other texts and the account of future effects. One way to bring out these differences is to look at the experience of researchers who are used to writing research articles, as they learn to write their first patents. I follow the drafting of patents by a zoologist (applying in the US) and a medical researcher (applying in the UK). They revised their texts in response to the comments of their patent agents, the patent examiners, the potential sponsors, and in response to their own continuing laboratory experiments. In both cases, the crucial areas of debate were the scope of the claims, the relation to prior and competing texts and the story that linked discovery and a range of possible applications. In each case the researchers and their agents developed textual devices appropriate to the discourse of patents: nesting claims, constructing an ideal reader, doubling the story. Their strategies for translating interests between their laboratories, sponsors, the patent agencies, potential users and the wider public raise the question of how separate arenas of knowledge and ownership are defined.},

We conducted a study of 62 scientific collaborations supported by a program of the US National Science Foundation in 1998 and 1999. Projects with principal investigators (PIs) in more disciplines reported as many positive outcomes as did projects involving fewer disciplines. By contrast, multi-university, rather than multidisciplinary, projects were problematic. Projects with PIs from more universities were significantly less well coordinated and reported fewer positive outcomes than projects with PIs from fewer universities. Coordination mechanisms that brought distant researchers together physically slightly reduced the negative impact of collaborations involving multiple universities.

Greater coordination problems are associated with size, distance, interdependence, and scientific competition. Problems of culture and security are associated with size, distance, scientific competition, and commercialization. Email use is associated with reporting fewer coordination problems, but not fewer problems of culture and security, while neither phone use nor face-to-face meetings significantly reduces problems.

Much to our surprise, the average age of inventors has been falling in all areas, despite rising levels of education.

	abstract = {Explanations of productivity differences between men and women in science tend to focus on the academic sector and the individual level. This article examines how variation in organizational logic affects sex differences in scientists' commercial productivity, as measured by patenting. Using detailed data from a sample of academic and industrial life scientists working in the United States, the authors present multivariate regression models of scientific patenting. The data show that controlling for education- and career-history variables, women are less likely to patent than men. However, in biotechnology firms—industrial settings characterized by flatter, more flexible, network-based organizational structures— women scientists are more likely to become patent-holding inventors than in more hierarchically arranged organizational settings in industry or academia. The authors discuss how the organization of scientists'work settings may influence enduring disparities between men and women in science and the implications of these findings for future work.},

Findings indicate that gender, family characteristics, and productivity are complex                 considerations that go beyond being married or not married, and the presence or                 absence of children. For women particularly, the relationship between marriage and                 productivity varies by type of marriage: first compared with subsequent                 marriage, and occupation of spouse (in scientific compared with non-scientific                 occupation). Further, type of family composition is important: women with preschool                 children have higher productivity than women without children or with school-age                 children. Women with preschool children are found to be a socially selective group                 in their characteristics, particularly in their allocations of time.},

We investigate gender disparities in commercial outcomes, for scientists in both the academic and industrial sectors. Using a unique combination of career history data and patenting information across a period of two decades, we present descriptive statistics and graphical trends of male and female commercialization. Empirical evidence indicates that female scientists engage in and produce less commercial work then their male counterparts, and that the degree of disparity remains constant across time. The quality and impact of women’s commercial work remains the same or better than that of men scientists, however. These results imply that a necessary focus for future work is to understand the personal, structural, and organizational reasons for the filtering process which leads to such a small proportion of female inventors.},

	abstract = {As university involvement in technology transfer and entrepreneurship has increased, concerns over the patenting and licensing of scientific discoveries have grown. This paper examines the effect that the licensing of academic patents has on journal citations to academic publications covering the same scientific research. We analyze data on invention disclosures, patents, and licenses from the University of California, a leading U.S. academic patenter and licensor, between 1997 and 2007. We also develop a novel “inventor–based” maximum–likelihood matching technique to automate and generalize Murray’s (2002) “patent–paper pairs” methodology. We use this methodology to identify the scientific publications associated with University of California patents and licenses.Based on a “difference–in–differences” analysis, we find that for patented academic discoveries in general, licensing appears to have little effect on journal citations to related scientific publications. When we examine the subset of discoveries that are not inputs to further research, however, licensing has a positive effect on journal citations to related scientific publications, suggesting that the successful negotiation of a license may demonstrate that a particular area of research has scientific value. In contrast, we find that licensing of research inputs (which we identify through the use of material transfer agreements, or MTAs) depresses citations to related scientific publications, raising the possibility that licensing may restrict the flow of inputs to “follow–on” scientific research.},

These models are eminently effective for an economy premised on physical production but are not well-suited for a more knowledge-oriented economy. Complexity science suggests a different paradigm for leadership—one that frames leadership as a complex interactive dynamic from which adaptive outcomes (e.g., learning, innovation, and adaptability) emerge. This article draws from complexity science to develop an overarching framework for the study of Complexity Leadership Theory, a leadership paradigm that focuses on enabling the learning, creative, and adaptive capacity of complex adaptive systems (CAS) within a context of knowledge-producing organizations. This conceptual framework includes three entangled leadership roles (i.e., adaptive leadership, administrative leadership, and enabling leadership) that reflect a dynamic relationship between the bureaucratic, administrative functions of the organization and the emergent, informal dynamics of complex adaptive systems (CAS).},

We then propose that there are weaknesses associated with cognitive abilities, motivation, social cognition and group dynamics that spring from the need to belong that are part and parcel of human nature such that their integration into one's sense of authenticity not only enhances the authentic leadership attributes of self-awareness, balanced processing, moral indentify and relational transparency but also benefits those who are led. We end with suggestions for future research on these attributes supplementing existing measures of authentic leadership with the use of implicit measures, promising assessment instruments and idiographic techniques.},

Combining theoretical approaches from dramaturgy and narrative research, we were able to identify possible antecedents that help followers perceive a leader's authenticity. Using two online experimental designs, we analyzed the concept of perceived leader authenticity. Specifically, we examined how a leader's enactment—that is, a leader's physical actions—(Study 1, n=105) and a combination of leader enactment and life storytelling (Study 2, n=334) influenced followers' perceptions of the leader's authenticity, and how this may impact leadership outcomes. The results of these studies, in which leader enactment in the context of authentic leadership was operationalized for the first time, indicate that leader enactment predicts perceived leader authenticity. Life storytelling, however, only partially predicted followers' perceptions of the leader's authenticity. Findings further revealed that followers' trust in the leader and positive emotions are outcomes of perceived leader authenticity. Implications for research and practice are discussed.},

In making this claim, we consider ways in which a somatic sense of self contributes to the felt sense of authenticity, and how through engaging with somatic cues, leadership can be performed in a way which is experienced as authentic, both to the leader and to those he or she seeks to lead. In developing our ideas further, we draw from the acting theory of Stanislavski (1936a, 1936b, 1961) to explore how authentic dramatic performances are created, focusing on the role of emotional memory, the magic ‘if’ and physical action in performances. We propose three key components of a resulting theory of how embodied authentic leadership is created: self exposure, relating, and making leaderly choices.},

Fortunately this problem is being addressed in recent research, with more attention being paid to the role of followership in the leadership process. The purpose of this article is to provide a systematic review of the followership literature, and from this review, introduce a broad theory of followership into leadership research. Based on our review, we identify two theoretical frameworks for the study of followership, one from a role-based approach (“reversing the lens”) and one from a constructionist approach (“the leadership process”). These frameworks are used to outline directions for future research. We conclude with a discussion of conceptual and methodological issues in the study of followership theory.},

Based upon data from 89 leaders and 460 followers in China, collected at two points in time, we found that leaders' moral identity and moral attentiveness are associated with follower's perceptions of ethical leadership. Ethical leadership is, in turn, associated with their followers' moral identity and moral attentiveness.

However, research on the boundary conditions that limit and/or enhance its effectiveness is still scarce, especially concerning one of the main misconceptions about ethical leadership, its incompatibility with effectiveness (Brown, Organ Dyn 36:140-155, 2007). Thus, the present study (a) examines the relationship between ethical leadership and organizational deviance via affective commitment to the organization, as a reflection of the quality of the employee-organization relationship and (b) proposes this relationship is conditional on the supervisor's personal reputation for performance (i.e., the moral standards are coupled with work effectiveness). Using a sample of 224 employees and their respective supervisors from 18 organizations, we confirmed our hypotheses (moderated mediation model). Our findings suggest that ethical leadership is positively related to employees' affective commitment to the organization, particularly when supervisor's reputation for performance is high, which in turn is associated with decreased organizational deviance. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings conclude the paper.},

Ethical leadership was the central concept modelled across both studies. Social cognitive theory, social identity theory and leadership categorization theory were used to support a model of how follower rank influences workplace outcomes through the mediating effect of ethical leadership. In addressing the ethical imperative of the employment relationship, these studies contribute to ethical leadership research in two ways. First, findings indicated that a follower's rank was positively associated with perceptions of ethical leadership, and second, that ethical leadership functioned as a partial mediator between rank/status and desirable workplace outcomes such as organizational fairness climate, career satisfaction and follower affective commitment.

	abstract = {With the present paper, we aim to provide new conceptual insights and empirical evidence on ethical leadership contingencies: we analyze under what conditions ethical leadership can positively impact follower discretionary work behaviors (extra effort and helping). We argue that followers vary in terms of their sensitivity toward and processing of moral information, as conveyed by ethical leaders, and that these individual differences determine the strength of the link between ethical leadership and follower discretionary work behaviors. In a multisource study with 135 leader-follower dyads, we examine two prototypical examples of affective and cognitive individual differences that involve a heightened inclination toward morality: follower moral emotions and follower mindfulness. Our findings indicate that ethical leadership is more strongly related to follower extra effort and helping at higher levels of follower moral emotions and higher levels of follower mindfulness. We discuss the implications of this moral information processing perspective on ethical leadership for research and managerial practice. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Follower organizational identification has been found to mediate the relationship between ethical leadership and follower job performance. In this research, we incorporate a second distinct and theoretically important type of social identification process, relational identification with the leader, along with organizational identification, and examine their mediating effects on follower performance and voice outcomes. Further, we bring the implicit theory of morality to the behavioral ethics literature and examine follower morality beliefs as a moderator. Using a Romanian sample of 302 followers under the supervision of 27 leaders, we found that ethical leadership has an indirect effect on follower job performance and voice (through the mediating mechanisms of both organizational and relational identifications) and that these relationships are stronger for followers who held the implicit theory that a person's moral character is fixed.

The extent to which public organizations and their employees emphasize normative public values in their decision-making can signal important messages to external stakeholders about respect for and responsiveness to all citizens, valuing citizens from different walks of life equally, and respect for constitutionally guaranteed rights. We propose a model in which transformational leadership has a direct influence (infusing) and an indirect influence (convincing others) on employee use of public values in organizational decision-making.

Next, I address what the research to date tells us about the effects of perceived ethical leader behavior, the mechanisms through which this form of leadership affects followers, and what the role of the context is.

In terms of incremental validity, we found that EL significantly, albeit weakly in some cases, predicted task performance, citizenship behavior, and counterproductive work behavior-even after controlling for the effects of such variables as transformational leadership, use of contingent rewards, management by exception, interactional fairness, and destructive leadership.

Some authors have attributed these scandals to the pre-eminence of a focus on increasing shareholder value in Western business schools and/or to their failure to inculcate ethical standards. In this paper, we challenge these accounts and the aetiological view of knowledge from which they derive but are grateful for the consensus that they convey regarding the importance of business ethics. The paper focuses on different approaches to ethical leadership concluding with a view that some hybrid of MacIntyre's virtue ethics and Levinas's ethics of responsibility may serve as an inspiration for both educators and practitioners.},

Based on the analysis of similarities between Western and Eastern moral philosophy and ethics principles of the world religions, the present approach identifies four essential normative reference points of ethical leadership the four central ethical orientations: (1) humane orientation, (2) justice orientation, (3) responsibility and sustainability orientation, and (4) moderation orientation. Research propositions on predictors and consequences of leader expressions of the four central orientations are offered. Real cases of ethical leadership choices, derived from in-depth interviews with international leaders, illustrate how the central orientations play out in managerial practice. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We theorize that CEOs' values may either enhance or attenuate the effect of transformational behaviors on followers, depending on followers' reactions to the congruence or incongruence between leaders' internal values and their outward transformational behaviors. Self-enhancement values-focusing on the leader's own happiness-would attenuate the effect, whereas self-transcendent values-focusing on others' happiness-would accentuate the effect of CEOs' transformational behaviors on followers' commitment. Using a sample of 45 managers in two companies in China, we validated a Q-sort method of measuring personal values. Results of a second study using cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys as well as interview data from a sample of Chinese CEOs, top managers, and middle managers supported both the attenuation and the accentuation effects and validated the idea that middle managers can detect their CEOs' values.(circle)},

Data from the Global Leadership and Organizational Effectiveness (GLOBE) project were then used to analyze the degree to which four aspects of ethical leadership - Character/Integrity, Altruism, Collective Motivation, and Encouragement - were endorsed as important for effective leadership across cultures. First, using multi-group confirmatory factor analyses measurement equivalence of the ethical leadership scales was found, which provides indication that the four dimensions have similar meaning across cultures. Then, using analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests each of the four dimensions were found to be universally endorsed as important for effective leadership. However, cultures also varied significantly in the degree of endorsement for each dimension. In the increasingly global business environment, these findings have implications for organizations implementing ethics programs across cultures and preparing leaders for expatriate assignments.},

Q. 10 (1999) 18 1] distinguish between authentic transformational leadership and inauthentic or pseudo-transformational leadership. The present article analyzes the conception of authenticity at the core of this normative account of leadership. I argue that the distinction between authentic transformational leadership and pseudo-transformational leadership fails to ground a sufficient response to ethical concerns about transformational leadership. To the extent that this theory holds that altruism suffices for ethical success, it misses the fact that leaders sometimes behave immorally precisely because they are blinded by their own values. In the end, we can expect that this kind of blindness will come to bear importantly on the moral psychology of leadership and, in some cases, encourage transformational leaders to believe that they are justified in making exceptions of themselves on the grounds that their leadership behavior is authentic.

This article proposes a theoretical model to identify conditions under which charismatic leadership and values inadvertently give rise to employee disenchantment, despite the good intentions of leaders and followers. The model integrates findings from a qualitative longitudinal study of a small advertising firm with prior research to develop new theory on unintended negative consequences of charismatic leadership. We propose that employee sensemaking triggered by strong organizational values can increase the risk of attributions of leader hypocrisy, which lead to employee disenchantment in a process we call the hypocrisy attribution dynamic. Value expansion, organizational tenure, and perceived benefit/harm are proposed to moderate the hypocrisy attribution dynamic, influencing the chances of negative sensemaking about leaders' behavior. This research sheds light on mechanisms through which charismatic leadership and values achieve their effects, and suggests that value expansion may be a double-edged sword-heightening followers' experience of meaning at work but also increasing the risk of subsequent disenchantment.

Questioning taken-for-granted systems can be perceived as threatening and needless, especially when one's career is dependent on the current system. Therefore one of the major challenges of teaching leadership from a critical perspective lies in persuading students of the need to think differently about leadership, organizations and themselves as leaders. The challenge can become particularly acute if the EMBA programme is based on conventional pedagogical premises and as a result, students come into the course expecting to be given tools to simplify their lives in the form of leadership principles and techniques. I will offer one way of thinking about leadership, drawing on the philosophical themes of relationalism, ethics and reflexivity. I begin by setting the context of the article in my experience of teaching an Executive Leadership course on a conventionally taught Executive MBA programme. I go on to introduce the three themes, which emerge from my interests in phenomenological philosophy, and examine their relevance and value to leadership and CMS, before discussing how each theme relates to the idea of a philosopher leader.},

Findings provide limited support for simple trickle-down mechanisms of ethical leadership but broader support for a multilevel model that takes into account how leaders embed shared understandings through their influence on the ethical culture of units at various levels, which in turn influence followers' ethical cognitions and behavior. The influences of ethical leadership occur not only directly, among immediate followers within a unit, but also indirectly, across hierarchical levels, through the cascading of ethical culture and senior leaders' influences on subordinate leader behavior.

Our results indicate that ethical leadership has both a direct and indirect influence on follower job satisfaction and affective commitment. The indirect effect of ethical leadership involves shaping perceptions of ethical climate, which in turn, engender greater job satisfaction and affective organizational commitment.

We also investigated how these leadership behaviors relate to effectiveness and optimism, using multiple-source ratings. Interviews with CEOs (N=73) were coded for the presence of leader's social responsibility and its facets. Also, using questionnaires, direct reports rated each CEOs' leader behavior (n=130) and a second group of direct reports (n=119) rated effectiveness and optimism. As expected, leaders high on social responsibility were rated higher on ethical leadership and lower on despotic leadership. Ethical leadership was also positively related to perceived top management team effectiveness and subordinates' optimism about the future of the organization and their own place within it.

Results, based on path analyses using LISREL, indicated that transformational leadership had both direct and indirect effects on performance mediated through followers' trust in the leader and value congruence. However, transactional leadership had only indirect effects on followers' performance mediated through followers' trust and value congruence.

Building on previous research, we argue that government employees with higher PSM are not only more likely to internalize values that support public interests, they also are likely to be concerned less about the potential consequences that they may experience by reporting unethical conduct within their agencies. Using data collected through a survey from 477 employees working in a large state agency, we find that supervisors with higher PSM are more likely to be perceived by their subordinates as exhibiting ethical leadership, supervisors exhibiting higher ethical leadership are more likely to have subordinates with higher levels of PSM and that subordinates with higher PSM express a higher willingness to report unethical behaviour within their agency. We discuss implications of these findings for research on PSM.},

The paper argues that transformational and transactional leadership behaviours are judged to be ethical based on two different sets of values, motives, and assumptions. These values, motives, and assumptions are grounded in two types of ethical perspective for understanding the behaviour of the two types of leaders. Transformational leaders have an organic worldview and moral altruistic motives grounded in a deontological perspective. Transactional leaders, on the other hand, have an atomistic worldview and mutual altruistic motives grounded in a teleological perspective.},

Developing a reputation for ethical leadership pays dividends in reduced legal problems and increased employee commitment, satisfaction, and employee ethical conduct. The alternatives are the unethical leader, the hypocritical leader (who talks the talk, but doesn't walk the walk), and the ethically neutral leader (who may be an ethical person, but employees don't know it because the leader has not made ethics and values an explicit part of the leadership agenda).

We find a direct negative relationship between both top management and supervisory ethical leadership and group-level deviance, and a positive relationship with group-level OCB. Finally, consistent with the proposed trickle-down model, the effects of top management ethical leadership on group-level deviance and OCB are mediated by supervisory ethical leadership.

Through a close evaluation of this literature, a more holistic understanding of "leadership" as a concept in LIS education can be better understood. Several topics are highlighted and discussed including the ambiguity in definitions of "leadership", the qualities of library leaders, leadership in LIS curriculum, library leadership and organization change, and library leadership and new librarians. For this review, the definition of LIS curriculum includes professional association leadership programs. Closing this literature review are recommendations for incorporating leadership education and mentorship opportunities into MLIS programs.},

In this study, leadership skill requirements are conceptualized as being layered (strata) and segmented (plex), and are thus described using a strataplex. Based on previous conceptualizations, this study proposes a model made up of four categories of leadership skill requirements: Cognitive skills, Interpersonal skills, Business skills, and Strategic skills. The model is then tested in a sample of approximately 1000 junior, midlevel, and senior managers, comprising a full career track in the organization. Findings support the “plex” element of the model through the emergence of four leadership skill requirement categories. Findings also support the “strata” portion of the model in that different categories of leadership skill requirements emerge at different organizational levels, and that jobs at higher levels of the organization require higher levels of all leadership skills. In addition, although certain Cognitive skill requirements are important across organizational levels, certain Strategic skill requirements only fully emerge at the highest levels in the organization. Thus a strataplex proved to be a valuable tool for conceptualizing leadership skill requirements across organizational levels.},

Among 802 unique abstracts, 42 studies reporting on 40 unique programs were selected for inclusion in this review. Of these, 28 programs were specifically designed to facilitate the development of junior or untenured librarians. Common program elements included participant input into mentor/mentee selection, written guidelines, mentor training, and senior administration support. Notably, only 18 authors (42.8\%) reported on program evaluation methods and outcomes. Despite the prevalence of the literature that exists on this topic, mentorship programs in academic libraries have been insufficiently explored. Rigorous and ongoing evaluation is required to determine the importance of mentoring programs to the career development of academic librarians, and identify design elements critical to their success.},

	abstract = {The goal of this study was to investigate the characteristics and perceived value of informal mentorship by conducting a survey of academic librarians and non-librarians with MLIS degrees in Illinois. The body of literature surrounding informal mentorship comprises of a very small portion of that which relates to mentorship in general. The literature often presented problematic definitions and posed questions of legitimacy as informal mentorship has qualities that have been cited as examples of poor mentoring relationships. Our survey data highlighted characteristics of informal mentoring relationships and suggested that informal mentorship has been considered as valuable and more widely accessible to mentees than formal mentorship.},

	abstract = {Mentoring expectations, activities, and support in Canadian college and university libraries were investigated by surveying 332 recent MLIS graduates, practicing academic librarians, and library administrators. Findings indicate that the presence of a mentoring program will help attract new librarians, retain them, and aid in restructuring efforts that are currently facing many academic libraries. Preferred mentoring activities include those belonging to psychosocial support, career guidance, and role modeling themes. Other results find that librarians who were mentored as new librarians, have more than 10 years of experience, and work in large academic institutions are significantly more likely to mentor others. Although currently not well-supported by academic administrators, this research shows that mentoring programs could be sustainable. Mentoring improves the professional experience for librarians who are more satisfied and engaged with their careers, which in turn benefits the organization with less turnover. Practical information from this research will guide academic library practitioners in current mentoring relationships, and library leaders can extrapolate results to support planning and implementation of mentoring programs. Implications for LIS education are also discussed.},

	title = {Leadership and {Service} {Provision} in {Public} {Libraries}},
	isbn = {978-981-4299-69-5},
	abstract = {The intention of this keynote is to present some more or less provocative ideas concerning the development of public libraries. In USA and Western Europe, we do witness the same types of developments in public libraries and we see very similar themes of discourses independent of the national and local culture in which these libraries operate. Some of the themes concern the management structure and organisation but more important is probably the current think about service delivery in a broad sense. Service delivery concerns the activities. It is areas like collection and collection management, the allocation of resources to the different part of the collection, the interplay and relationship between national internet-based delivery and the local service. Another important theme is the effort concerning the public library and its integration into the community taking up different forms of citizen services, cooperation and partnership with the local community, but also a focus on playing a new and more active role in the cultural scene by for example emphasising learning activities, lifelong learning, internet courses and different forms for events and exhibitions. The ambition is to become a local meeting place, a third room; a common intended to generate social capital. This discourse and many of the activities resulting from it like 23 thinks, the libraries in the second world and experiments with various forms of social technology appear to how a great appeal in the library profession. However, both library statistics and numerous studies of users and their preferences give a more differentiated picture. In most countries, the public libraries face economic hardship. They witness stagnating or decreasing numbers of visitors and the issues of traditional materials also tend to decrease. The public appear to value especially the services and products that suffer due to economic pressures and the internal priority setting in libraries. Overall, it appears at least at the surface that users do have a rather traditional view of the public library and their stated preferences also seems to be very traditional as they are oriented towards books and information and to a lesser degree towards new services and delivery forms. It is of course of paramount interest to investigate possible discrepancies between the discourse and the practices in the professions and the users' preferences, priorities and level of satisfaction. There is probably no right solution to the problem, but it is of both a practical and theoretical significance to investigate which factors influence the development of the discourse and the activities in the professions and in the public libraries and is also important to be able to measure users perception of the significance and importance of the service delivery and to which degree this is connected with measures of satisfaction. The keynote discusses users' perception of the significance of the various services and presents a model for how it is possible to measure the significance of the single service. This measure is related to measures of satisfaction and what influence that factor. The keynote further discusses the factors behind the profession's discourse and practices. The concept of an organisational recipe is introduced in relation to organisational culture as two factors that have influence on the way libraries tend to adopt different forms of innovations. Of course, leadership plays an important role and the keynote also introduces measures of the personality traits of library directors and discusses this in relation to the innovation and development process but also in relation to the "sense" or construction the profession is creating of the user. Finally, the keynote discuss possible consequences and outcomes of the fragile relationship between users and a public service as public libraries.},

Design/methodology/approach - A literature review on academic library leadership was conducted. Particular attention was placed on the three common leadership modes in academic libraries: emergent leadership, team leadership and headship. The review covers librarians' conception of leadership, desirable leadership capabilities and existing leadership development. Findings - Librarians view leadership as a process of influence, and understand that leadership does not only come from formal leaders. Lacking is a more structured knowledge of what constitute effect leadership. In the literature, team and emergent leadership have not been adequately explored; most leadership research in the field takes on a headship approach. Research limitations/implications - The publications reviewed were selective; not all papers on the topic were included. Practical implications - Featuring the three leadership modes brings librarians' attention to the crucial differences among them; and hence directs future discussion to a more focused approach that addresses each leadership mode specifically. Originality/value - This paper differs from previous literature reviews on library leadership; it is the first one comparing and contrasting publications using the three leadership modes.},

The two research questions addressed by this portion of the research project were: (1) is the perception of library leadership skill and quality development equal across departmental experience? and (2) what are the leadership skills and qualities most commonly perceived to be used in each department? Findings revealed that respondents perceived that there were great opportunities to exercise leadership qualities in previous positions, but few opportunities to develop more empirically measurable leadership skills. In addition, respondents perceived those skill development opportunities to be available only once working in the position of library director or in the administration department of academic libraries.

Findings - The paper elucidates a number of limitations to the current practice of using the phrase "buy in" as a way of exploring the concept of social capital. The most significant risk that the phrase's use incurs is a lack of context and clarity around critical concepts of leadership, including trust, trustworthiness, and shared vision and meaning.

As organizational charts flatten increased levels of responsibility are expected of employees.

This paper describes a collaborative project between the University of Houston Libraries Training Committee and the University of Houston Human Resources Department (HR) in which emerging leaders within the library attended a semester-long intensive program designed to nurture Excellence in Library Leadership (ELLP). Successful applicants to the University of Houston Libraries ELLP participated in personality and emotional intelligence assessments; attended six interactive day-long sessions with content specifically tailored to leadership skills in the library setting; and formed a cohort that has been active in planning and advocating for continued leadership and emotional intelligence training within the organization. This paper discusses the content of the program, the lessons learned from two cohorts, information about how other libraries might pilot a similar program, and a description of how the ELLP is impacting UH Libraries' culture.

Primarily, the goals are to identify: first, the top five major challenges facing academic library leadership; second, the top five most important leadership skills required for effective academic library leadership; and finally, the top five best ways to develop these academic library leadership skills. Design/methodology/approach - A survey was conducted to elicit responses from individuals who hold senior library leadership positions in American academic libraries throughout the USA. The participants were identified through several means: the web sites of the ALA and its divisions; the web sites of American universities; referrals; and the author's professional contacts. To simplify the survey research process, e-mails including the survey research questions were sent to potential participants. In all, 38 invitations (n = 38) were sent out to large and medium-size academic libraries throughout the USA. Over 36.8 percent (n = 14) of the participants returned the survey. The participants represent a wide spectrum of libraries. Findings - The top five major challenges are how to: demonstrate the library values to the university community, operate the library under fiscal uncertainty, retrofit outdated library facilities to accommodate new services, strike a balance between digital and print materials, and keep the library staff trained and current. The top five essential academic library leadership attributes are: vision, integrity, management skills, collaboration skills, and communication skills. The top five best ways to acquire these skills include the need to have mentors, to attend leadership development programs, to gain practical library leadership experience, to seek leadership roles, and to know oneself. Originality/value - Research in this area is rather limited. As a result, this study will contribute to the academic library leadership literature and help current and aspiring academic library leaders worldwide with insightful leadership lessons needed to lead academic libraries successfully in this transformational era.},

	abstract = {Four librarians from Irish university libraries completed the U.K. Future Leaders Programme (FLP) in 2010. In this article they recount their experience and assess the effect of the programme on their professional practice and the value for their institutions. The programme is explored in the context of the Irish higher education environment, which is facing significant challenges due to the demise of the Celtic Tiger economy. A brief review of the literature relating to structured programmes to prepare librarians for senior positions, is presented. The structure and content of the FLP and the learning methodologies, theories, tools and techniques used throughout are discussed. The article suggests that the programme has real value for both individuals and institutions and that it can play a significant role in succession planning and the leadership development of librarians.},

This list was used to learn the locus (subfield) of leadership and the degree of fieldwide integration as evidenced by the extent of shared perceptions by respondents. Results revealed that leaders tend to be associated most strongly with a category labeled "other" whose members may serve as professionals' professionals; that is, high status field members and directing professional associations. Some fieldwide integration is indicated by agreement on the nomination of two people by a significant portion of respondents from six subfields. Nominators in three subfields frequently concurred in their leader choices creating a de facto community of shared perceptions, and, by implication, shared values which, in turn, may influence the profession's agenda and priorities.},

The purpose of the post-hierarchical library is to increase user satisfaction with reduced resources and more staff empowerment. It is being propelled by rising user service demands, increasing costs, new technologies, and internal and commercial competition. The post-hierarchical library leader is a planner, coordinator, motivator, negotiator, innovator, communicator, listener, recruiter, risk taker, problem solver, and evaluator. The leader's responsibilities include adopting and exemplifying a user satisfaction mind set, defining and articulating the mission and strategic plan, creating a supporting technology and knowledge-sharing infrastructure, and fostering relationships and teams. The significant impediments to the development of the post-hierarchical library are the inertia of the parent institution, the leader, the staff, and the motivation for change.},

And what measures, if any, have M LIS programs taken to address it?

Discursively, leadership is strongly tied to discourses of management, change, and youth. Preparing leaders is a stated goal of most ALA-accredited LIS programs; however, the discourse on leadership within the profession indicates that schools of LIS may be paying more attention to leadership within their curricula, specifically in management classes.},

This research forms part of a larger study that investigated the education needs of information professionals who will work in a converged environment. Method. A relatively unknown method called the grounded Delphi method was used. Data was collected in rounds as for a Delphi study, with the data analysis incorporating elements of grounded theory. Analysis. Focus groups were audio recorded and recordings transcribed. Coding techniques were then applied allowing for similarities and differences in the data to be identified. Results. While common skills and knowledge across all four sectors were identified, including problem solving, critical thinking, critical analysis, written and oral communication, adaptability and leadership, the two most emphatically endorsed by all participants were a passion for and an understanding of the sector. Conclusions. This paper provides the first empirical evidence of skills and knowledge required of information professionals in galleries, libraries, archives and museums in Australia. This can be used to inform what these professionals should be learning in an information management education programme.},

Firstly, the leader's behavior is focused on completing the project combined with a leadership style which is more interventionist and less conciliatory. The second leadership model focuses on working relationships, developed between leaders and employees. In this case, the character of the model is associated with a leadership behavior more supportive, motivating and participative. This article refers to the characteristics of the two models and the mechanisms and strategies that can be adopted in both leadership behaviors. Furthermore, through the research which took place, we have come to conclusions regarding the public's views about the different leadership behaviors and, also, the possibility of combining the two styles of leadership.},

	abstract = {This study identified the competencies that library and information professionals in Kuwait will need to be successful in their leadership positions. The researchers prepared a list of 42 leadership competencies based on an extensive literature review. The competencies were grouped under six meta-competencies: managerial effectiveness, cognitive, social, motivational, personal, and occupational competencies. The list was distributed to 141 library managers, 79 men and 62 women representing four types of libraries: 37 in public libraries, 42 in academic libraries, 27 in school libraries, and 35 in special libraries and information centres. Respondents were asked to rate each competency according to its importance. The results include the top competencies rated highly by participants. The development of this leadership competency model for library leaders should contribute to the mission of library profession and guide decision makers with selection, appraisal, curricula design, and development efforts. This model is not static. It must be revised and validated continuously as the nature of the library and information environment changes and progresses.},

Other professions, e. g., medicine and engineering, have been updating their curricula to encompass the "soft skills" of leadership and emotional intelligence, but library and information science graduates, for the most part must seek other venues to attain leadership competencies. Recent emphasis in leadership training focuses on self awareness and reflection, and also on understanding one's temperament and strengths. This approach is seen as providing the self confidence needed rather than expending effort and training on eliminating weaknesses as is often the present practice. With this as a basis, participants prepare an agenda and strategic plan, and move into study and practice of areas of emotional intelligence, such as being able to regulate one's own emotions, read other people, empathize, practice tolerance, understand group dynamics, and conflict management. It is urgent that educators recognize that academic content is not enough. It is time to also focus on process.},

A number of leader and leadership development programs have emerged in Australia, Canada and the United States that attract interested participants, yet what is the core purpose of these programs? Do they work? Review of leadership programs reveals that systematic and ongoing evaluation is not only missing as a key factor for determining effectiveness but evaluation is challenging at best, as few programs have stated goals and objectives that enable evaluation. This paper reviews current research literature of leadership development programs in Business and in Library and Information Science, including program foundations, characteristics unique to librarianship and program evaluation, to determine if there are key indicators for successful programs and their evaluation. The resulting findings may guide the revision of current programs and lead to the development of new programs that ensure that current gaps in the pool of emergent leaders are bridged, in part, by improved leadership programs and institutes.},

Although reusing data might not yet be the norm in every discipline, the benefits of reusing shared data have been asserted by a number of researchers, and data reuse has been a major concern in many disciplines. Assessing data for trustworthiness becomes important in data reuse with the growth in data creation because of the lack of standards for ensuring data quality and potential harm from using poor-quality data. This research explores many facets of data reusers' trust in data generated by other researchers focusing on the trust judgment process with influential factors that determine reusers' trust. The author took an interpretive qualitative approach by using in-depth semistructured interviews as the primary research method. The study results suggest different stages of trust development associated with the process of data reuse. Data reusers' trust may remain the same throughout their experiences, but it can also be formed, lost, declined, and recovered during their data reuse experiences. These various stages reflect the dynamic nature of trust.},

	abstract = {Recent works in the information science literature have presented cases of using patent databases and patent classification information to construct network maps of technology fields, which aim to aid in competitive intelligence analysis and innovation decision making. Constructing such a patent network requires a proper measure of the distance between different classes of patents in the patent classification systems. Despite the existence of various distance measures in the literature, it is unclear how to consistently assess and compare them, and which ones to select for constructing patent technology network maps. This ambiguity has limited the development and applications of such technology maps. Herein, we propose to compare alternative distance measures and identify the superior ones by analyzing the differences and similarities in the structural properties of resulting patent network maps. Using United States patent data from 1976 to 2006 and the International Patent Classification (IPC) system, we compare 12 representative distance measures, which quantify interfield knowledge base proximity, field-crossing diversification likelihood or frequency of innovation agents, and co-occurrences of patent classes in the same patents. Our comparative analyses suggest the patent technology network maps based on normalized coreference and inventor diversification likelihood measures are the best representatives.},

Most of the studies show that the two variables are closely related: An increasing collaboration activity (measured in terms of number of authors, number of affiliations, and number of countries) is associated with an increased citation impact. However, it is not clear whether the increased citation impact is based on the higher quality of papers that profit from more than one scientist giving expert input or other (citation-specific) factors. Thus, the current study addresses this question by using two comprehensive data sets with publications (in the biomedical area) including quality assessments by experts (F1000Prime member scores) and citation data for the publications. The study is based on more than 15,000 papers. Robust regression models are used to investigate the relationship between number of authors, number of affiliations, and number of countries, respectively, and citation impact-controlling for the papers' quality (measured by F1000Prime expert ratings). The results point out that the effect of collaboration activities on impact is largely independent of the papers' quality. The citation advantage is apparently not quality related; citation-specific factors (e.g., self-citations) seem to be important here.},

Examining the distribution of FA by citation index database, by language, and by acknowledgment type, we noted coverage limitations and potential biases in each analysis.

However, these solutions besides being very expensive and having scalability problems, also may not benefit from eventual manual corrections, as they may be lost whenever the process of disambiguating the entire repository is required. In the real world, in which repositories are updated on a daily basis, incremental solutions that disambiguate only the newly introduced citation records, are likely to produce improved results in the long run. However, the problem of incremental author name disambiguation has been largely neglected in the literature. In this article we present a new author name disambiguation method, specially designed for the incremental scenario. In our experiments, our new method largely outperforms recent incremental proposals reported in the literature as well as the current state-of-the-art non-incremental method.},

We attempt to explain the major motivations, characteristics of communication and information sharing, and barriers associated with scientists' research collaboration practices throughout the research life cycle. The findings identify several notable phenomena including motivating factors, the timing of collaboration formation, partner selection, communication methods, information-sharing practices, and barriers at each phase of the life cycle. We find that specific motivations were related to specific phases. The formation of collaboration was observed throughout the entire process, not only in the beginning phase of the cycle. For communication and information-sharing practices, scientists continue to favor traditional means of communication for security reasons. Barriers to collaboration throughout the phases included different priorities, competitive tensions, and a hierarchical culture among collaborators, whereas credit sharing was a barrier in the research product phase.},

All authors in the science network receive the majority of their credit from high-impact authors; however, this effect decreases as authors' impact levels decrease. Similarly, the proportion of citations that lower-impact authors make to each other increases as authors' impact levels decrease. High-impact authors, who have the highest degree of membership in the science network, publish fewer papers in comparison to highly productive authors. However, authors with the highest impact make both more references per paper and also more citations to papers in the science network. This suggests that high-impact authors produce the most relevant work in the science network. Comparing practices by productivity level, authors receive the majority of their credit from highly productive authors and authors cite highly productive authors more frequently than less productive authors.},

This study analyzes data from 23 UK institutions covering the period 2007-2014 modeling the TCP. It shows a clear rise in centrally managed APC payments from 2012 onward, with payments projected to increase further. As well as evidencing the growing availability and acceptance of OA publishing, these trends reflect particular UK policy developments and funding arrangements intended to accelerate the move toward OA publishing (Gold OA). Although the mean value of APCs has been relatively stable, there was considerable variation in APC prices paid by institutions since 2007. In particular, hybrid subscription/OA journals were consistently more expensive than fully OA journals. Most APCs were paid to large traditional commercial publishers who also received considerable subscription income. New administrative costs reported by institutions varied considerably. The total cost of publication modeling shows that APCs are now a significant part of the TCP for academic institutions, in 2013 already constituting an average of 10\% of the TCP (excluding administrative costs).},

Interdisciplinarity is operationalized by the diversity of subject fields assigned to cited items in the article's reference list. Subject fields and subfields were obtained from the Leuven-Budapest (ECOOM) subject-classification scheme, while disciplinary diversity was measured taking variety, balance, and disparity into account. As diversity measure we use a Hill-type true diversity in the sense of Jost and Leinster-Cobbold. The analysis is conducted in 3 steps. In the first part, the properties of this measure are discussed, and, on the basis of these properties it is shown that the measure has the potential to serve as an indicator of interdisciplinarity. In the second part the applicability of this indicator is shown using selected journals from several research fields ranging from mathematics to social sciences. Finally, the often-heard argument, namely, that interdisciplinary research exhibits larger visibility and impact, is studied on the basis of these selected journals. Yet, as only 7 journals, representing a total of 15,757 articles, are studied, albeit chosen to cover a large range of interdisciplinarity, further research is still needed.},

The results show that, holding other factors constant, larger teams robustly associate with higher impact research, but including additional departments has no effect and adding extra institutions tends to reduce the impact of research. Although international collaboration is apparently not advantageous in general, collaboration with the United States, and perhaps also with some other countries, seems to increase impact. In contrast, collaborations with some other nations seems to decrease impact, although both findings could be due to factors such as differing national proportions of excellent researchers.

This approach bears the risk of incorrectly merging or splitting author identities. The use of initial-based disambiguation has been justified by the assumption that such errors would not affect research findings too much. This paper tests that assumption by analyzing coauthorship networks from five academic fields-biology, computer science, nanoscience, neuroscience, and physics-and an interdisciplinary journal, PNAS. Name instances in data sets of this study were disambiguated based on heuristics gained from previous algorithmic disambiguation solutions. We use disambiguated data as a proxy of ground-truth to test the performance of three types of initial-based disambiguation. Our results show that initial-based disambiguation can misrepresent statistical properties of coauthorship networks: It deflates the number of unique authors, number of components, average shortest paths, clustering coefficient, and assortativity, while it inflates average productivity, density, average coauthor number per author, and largest component size. Also, on average, more than half of top 10 productive or collaborative authors drop off the lists. Asian names were found to account for the majority of misidentification by initial-based disambiguation due to their common surname and given name initials.},

First, I apply a fuzzy string matching algorithm for self-citation detection and benchmark this approach and other common methods of exclusively author name-based self-citation detection against a manually curated ground truth sample. Near full recall can be achieved with the proposed method while incurring only negligible precision loss. Second, I report some important observations from the results about the extent of latent self-citations and their characteristics and give an example of the effect of improved self-citation detection on the document level self-citation rate of real data.},

Proponents of the altmetrics approach have pointed out that new media allow for new avenues of scientific impact assessment. Traditional impact measures based on bibliographic analysis have long been criticized for overlooking the relational dynamics of scientific impact. We therefore propose an application of social network analysis to researchers' interactions on an academic social networking site to generate potential new metrics of scientific impact. Based on a case study conducted among a sample of Swiss management scholars, we analyze how centrality measures derived from the participants' interactions on the academic SNS ResearchGate relate to traditional, offline impact indicators. We find that platform engagement, seniority, and publication impact contribute to members' indegree and eigenvector centrality on the platform, but less so to closeness or betweenness centrality. We conclude that a relational approach based on social network analyses of academic SNS, while subject to platform-specific dynamics, may add richness and differentiation to scientific impact assessment.},

In this work, we propose a novel descriptive clustering framework, referred to as CEDL. It relies on the formulation and generation of 2 types of heterogeneous objects, which correspond to documents and candidate phrases, using multilevel similarity information. CEDL is composed of 5 main processing stages. First, it simultaneously maps the documents and candidate phrases into a common co-embedded space that preserves higher-order, neighbor-based proximities between the combined sets of documents and phrases. Then, it discovers an approximate cluster structure of documents in the common space. The third stage extracts promising topic phrases by constructing a discriminant model where documents along with their cluster memberships are used as training instances. Subsequently, the final cluster labels are selected from the topic phrases using a ranking scheme using multiple scores based on the extracted co-embedding information and the discriminant output. The final stage polishes the initial clusters to reduce noise and accommodate the multitopic nature of documents. The effectiveness and competitiveness of CEDL is demonstrated qualitatively and quantitatively with experiments using document databases from different application fields.},

Whether the use of these advanced methods, which are often difficult to implement, is warranted depends on whether the accuracy of the most basic disambiguation methods, which only use the author's last name and initials, is sufficient for a particular purpose. We derive realistic estimates for the accuracy of simple, initials-based methods using simulated bibliographic datasets in which the true identities of authors are known. Based on the simulations in five diverse disciplines we find that the first initial method already correctly identifies 97\% of authors. An alternative simple method, which takes all initials into account, is typically two times less accurate, except in certain datasets that can be identified by applying a simple criterion. Finally, we introduce a new name-based method that combines the features of first initial and all initials methods by implicitly taking into account the last name frequency and the size of the dataset. This hybrid method reduces the fraction of incorrectly identified authors by 10-30\% over the first initial method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This study presents various options for dealing with this problem in statistical analysis. The publications from two universities from 2000 to 2011 are used as a sample dataset (n = 2652, univ 1 = 1484 and univ 2 = 1168). One option is to show the citation impact data (percentiles) in a graphic and to use a line for percentiles regressed on 'distant' publication years (with confidence interval) showing the trend for the 'very recent' publication years. Another way of dealing with the problem is to work with the concept of samples and populations. The third option (very related to the second) is the application of the counterfactual concept of causality. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Analysis of the collected bibliometric data shows that a publication impact is significantly and positively associated with all related geographical collaboration indicators. But publication impact has a stronger association with the numbers of external collaborations at department and institution levels (inter-departmental and inter-institutional collaborations) compared to internal collaborations. Conversely, national collaboration correlates better with impact than international collaboration. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Secondly, when the normalization procedures are based on two different classification systems, we introduce two new rankings following the graphical and the numerical approaches. Each ranking is based on a double test that assesses the two normalization procedures in terms of the two classification systems on which they depend. Thirdly, we also compare the two normalization procedures using a third, independent classification system for evaluation purposes. In the empirical part of the paper we use: (i) a classification system consisting of 219 sub-fields identified with the Web of Science subject-categories; an aggregate classification system consisting of 19 broad fields, as well as a systematic and a random assignment of articles to sub-fields with the aim of maximizing or minimizing differences across sub-fields; (ii) four normalization procedures that use the field or sub-field mean citations of the above four classification systems as normalization factors; and (iii) a large dataset, indexed by Thomson Reuters, in which 4.4 million articles published in 1998-2003 with a five-year citation window are assigned to sub-fields using a fractional approach. The substantive results concerning the comparison of the four normalization procedures indicate that the methodology can be useful in practice. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Percentile-based approaches have been proposed as a non-parametric alternative to parametric central-tendency statistics. Percentiles are based on an ordered set of citation counts in a reference set, whereby the fraction of papers at or below the citation counts of a focal paper is used as an indicator for its relative citation impact in the set. In this study, we pursue two related objectives: (I) although different percentile-based approaches have been developed, an approach is hitherto missing that satisfies a number of criteria such as scaling of the percentile ranks from zero (all other papers perform better) to 100 (all other papers perform worse), and solving the problem with tied citation ranks unambiguously. We introduce a new citation-rank approach having these properties, namely P100; (2) we compare the reliability of P100 empirically with other percentile-based approaches, such as the approaches developed by the SCImago group, the Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS), and Thomson Reuters (InCites), using all papers published in 1980 in Thomson Reuters Web of Science (WoS). How accurately can the different approaches predict the long-term citation impact in 2010 (in year 31) using citation impact measured in previous time windows (years 1-30)? The comparison of the approaches shows that the method used by InCites overestimates citation impact (because of using the highest percentile rank when papers are assigned to more than a single subject category) whereas the SCImago indicator shows higher power in predicting the long-term citation impact on the basis of citation rates in early years. Since the results show a disadvantage in this predictive ability for P100 against the other approaches, there is still room for further improvements. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We introduce a new method to assess the universality of any scholarly impact metric, and apply it to evaluate a number of established metrics. We also define a very simple new metric h(s), which proves to be universal, thus allowing to compare the impact of scholars across scientific disciplines. These results move us closer to a formal methodology in the measure of scholarly impact. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

In this research, we utilize a two-step citation analysis method to investigate the importance of publications for which citation information is partially missing. First, we calculate the importance of the author and then use his importance to estimate the publication importance for some selected articles. To evaluate this method, we designed a simulation experimentrandom citation-missingto test the two-step citation analysis that we carried out with the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library (DL). In this experiment, we simulated different scenarios in a large-scale scientific digital library, from high-quality citation data, to very poor quality data, The results show that a two-step citation analysis can effectively uncover the importance of publications in different situations. More importantly, we found that the optimized impact from the importance of an author (first step) is exponentially increased when the quality of citation decreases. The findings from this study can further enhance citation-based publication-ranking algorithms for real-world applications.},

The complete link cluster method was on theoretical grounds assumed to provide a suitable cluster method for this purpose. The objective of the study was to evaluate the proposed method's capability to identify coherent research themes. Applying a large multidisciplinary test bed comprising more than 600,000 articles and 17 million references, the proposed method was tested in accordance with two lines of mapping. In the first line of mapping, all significant (strong) links connecting `core documents' (strongly and frequently coupled documents) in clusters with any other core document was mapped. This resulted in a depiction of all significant artificially broken links between core documents in a cluster and core documents extrinsic to that cluster. The second line of mapping involved the application of links between clusters only. They were used to successively merge clusters on two subsequent levels of fusion, where the first generation of clusters were considered objects for a second clustering, and the second generation of clusters gave rise to a final cluster fusion. Changes of cluster composition on the three levels were evaluated with regard to several variables. Findings showed that the proposed method could provide with valid depictions of current research, though some severe restrictions would adhere to its application. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The first method is an algorithm based on a reward function, and the second is a statistical method. Experiments were carried out to validate the techniques proposed. The results show that both methods for threshold estimation produce similar results. The output of such methods was used to design a grading function for similarity functions.

Early studies showed a correlation between the free online availability or OA status of articles and higher citation counts, and implied causality without due consideration of potential confounding factors. More recent investigations have dissected the nature of the relationship between article CA status and citations. Three non-exclusive postulates have been proposed to account for the observed citation differences between OA and non-OA articles: an open access postulate, a selection bias postulate, and an early view postulate. The most rigorous study to date (in condensed matter physics) showed that, after controlling for the early view postulate, the remaining difference in citation counts between OA and non-OA articles is explained by the selection bias postulate. No evidence was found to support the OA postulate per se; i.e. article OA status alone has little or no effect on citations. Further studies using a similarly rigorous approach are required to determine the generality of this finding. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Therefore, this has been a methodological issue in ACA study. This paper empirically examines the impact of the ISI convention on the results of ACA.

Using our data and cociation matrix generation systems, we compare the differences in the process and outcomes of using different cocitation matrices.

Using Scopus instead of SSCI as the data source, we find that results from a theoretically optimal all-author ACA appear to be excellent in practice, too, although in a field like IS where co-authorship levels are relatively low, its advantages over classic first-author ACA appear considerably smaller than in the more highly collaborative ones targeted before. Nevertheless, we do find some differences between the two approaches, in that first-author ACA appears to favor theorists who presumably tend to work alone, while all-author ACA appears to paint a somewhat more recent picture of the field, and to pick out some collaborative author clusters.

The theory is derived from a recurring theme found in a diverse range of scientific change, scientific discovery, and knowledge diffusion theories in philosophy of science, sociology of science, social network analysis, and information science. The theory extends the concept of structural holes from social networks to a broader range of associative networks found in science studies, especially including networks that reflect underlying intellectual structures such as co-citation networks and collaboration networks. The central premise is that connecting otherwise disparate patches of knowledge is a valuable mechanism of creative thinking in general and transformative scientific discovery in particular. In addition, the premise consistently explains the value of connecting people from different disciplinary specialties. The theory not only explains the nature of transformative discoveries in terms of the brokerage mechanism but also characterizes the subsequent diffusion process as optimal information foraging in a problem space. Complementary to epidemiological models of diffusion, foraging-based conceptualizations offer a unified framework for arriving at insightful discoveries and optimizing subsequent pathways of search in a problem space. Structural and temporal properties of potentially high-impact scientific discoveries are derived from the theory to characterize the emergence and evolution of intellectual networks of a field. Two Nobel Prize winning discoveries, the discovery of Helicobacter pylori and gene targeting techniques, and a discovery in string theory demonstrated such properties. Connections to and differences from existing approaches are discussed. The primary value of the theory is that it provides not only a computational model of intellectual growth, but also concrete and constructive explanations of where one may find insightful inspirations for transformative scientific discoveries.

Recent studies have shown that scientists can benefit from their position within collaborative networks by being able to receive more information of better quality in a timely fashion, and by presiding over communication between collaborators. Here we focus on the tendency of scientists to cluster into tightly knit communities, and discuss the implications of this tendency for scientific production. We begin by reviewing a new method for finding communities, and we then assess its benefits in terms of computation time and accuracy. While communities often serve as a taxonomic scheme to map knowledge domains, they also affect the way scientists engage in the creation of new knowledge. By drawing on the longstanding debate on the relative benefits of social cohesion and brokerage, we discuss the conditions that facilitate collaborations among scientists within or across communities. We show that highly cited scientific production occurs within communities, when scientists have cohesive collaborations with others from the same knowledge domain, and across communities, when scientists intermediate among otherwise disconnected collaborators from different knowledge domains. We also discuss the implications of communities for information diffusion, and show how traditional epidemiological approaches need to be refined to take knowledge heterogeneity into account and preserve the system's ability to promote creative processes of novel recombinations of ideas.

Using 25 million papers and 600 million references from the Web of Science over the 1900-2006 period, this paper proposes a simple model based on a random selection process to explain the “uncitedness” phenomenon and its decline over the years. We show that the proportion of cited papers is a function of (1) the number of articles available (the competing papers), (2) the number of citing papers and (3) the number of references they contain. Using uncitedness as a departure point, we demonstrate the utility of the stretched-exponential function and a form of the Tsallis q-exponential function to fit complete citation distributions over the 20th century. As opposed to simple power-law fits, for instance, both these approaches are shown to be empirically well-grounded and robust enough to better understand citation dynamics at the aggregate level. On the basis of these models, we provide quantitative evidence and provisional explanations for an important shift in citation practices around 1960. We also propose a revision of the “citation classic” category as a set of articles which is clearly distinguishable from the rest of the field. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We propose that word co-occurrences on Webpages can be a measure of the relatedness of organizations. Word co-occurrence data can be collected from both general search engines and blog search engines, which expands data sources greatly. The proposed concept is tested in a group of companies in the LTE and WiMax sectors of the telecommunications industry. Data on the co-occurrences of company names on Webpages were collected from Google and Google Blog. The co-occurrence matrices were analyzed using MDS. The resulting MDS maps were compared with industry reality and with the MDS maps from co-link analysis. Results show that Web co-word analysis could potentially be as useful as Web co-link analysis.

The effects of various normalizations are specified and measured using the matrix of 8207 journals contained in the Journal Citation Reports of the (Social) Science Citation Index 2008. Betweenness centrality in symmetrical (1-mode) cosine-normalized networks provides an indicator outperforming betweenness in the asymmetrical (2-mode) citation network. Among the vector-based indicators, Shannon entropy performs better than the Gini coefficient, but is sensitive to size. Science and Nature, for example, are indicated at the top of the list. The new diversity measure provides reasonable results when (1 - cosine) is assumed as a measure for the distance, but results using Euclidean distances were difficult to interpret.

This literature review began with a narrow search for quantitative measures of the output of IDR that could contribute to indicators, but the authors expanded the scope of the review as it became clear that differing definitions, assessment tools, evaluation processes, and measures all shed light on different aspects of IDR. Key among these broader aspects is (a) the importance of incorporating the concept of knowledge integration, and (b) recognizing that integration can occur within a single mind as well as among a team. Existing output measures alone cannot adequately capture this process. Among the quantitative measures considered, bibliometrics (co-authorships, co-inventors, collaborations, references, citations and co-citations) are the most developed, but leave considerable gaps in understanding of the social dynamics that lead to knowledge integration. Emerging measures in network dynamics (particularly betweenness centrality and diversity), and entropy are promising as indicators, but their use requires sophisticated interpretations. Combinations of quantitative measures and qualitative assessments being applied within evaluation studies appear to reveal IDR processes but carry burdens of expense, intrusion, and lack of reproducibility year-upon-year. This review is a first step toward providing a more holistic view of measuring IDR, although research and development is needed before metrics can adequately reflect the actual phenomenon of IDR.

Moreover, the difference between both measures is strongly influenced by the number of papers published as well as by their impact scores: the difference between AoR and RoA is greater for departments, institutions and countries with low RoA scores. Finally, our results show that RoA relative impact indicators do not add up to unity (as they should by definition) at the level of the reference dataset, whereas the AoR does have that property.

Both at a national and an institutional level it was found that a larger publication output is associated with a higher citation impact.

But a regression analysis found no evidence that more concentration of research among a country's universities or among an institution's main fields is associated with better overall performance. The study reveals a tendency that the research in a particular subject field conducted in universities specializing in other fields outperforms the work in that field in institutions specializing in that field. This outcome may reflect that it is multi-disciplinary research that is the most promising and visible at the international research front, and that this type of research tends to develop better in universities specializing in a particular domain and expanding their capabilities in that domain towards other fields.

Several numerical indicators have been introduced with this aim, but so far a specific statistical test for estimating the fairness of these numerical indicators has not been developed. Here we present a statistical method aimed at estimating the effectiveness of numerical indicators in the suppression of citation biases. The method is simple to implement and can be easily generalized to various scenarios. As a practical example we test, in a controlled case, the fairness of fractional citation count, which has been recently proposed as a tool for cross-discipline comparison. We show that this indicator is not able to remove biases in citation patterns and performs much worse than the rescaling of citation counts with average values. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Globalization of science, in this respect, implies that collaboration among scientists takes place along the lines of common topics and irrespective of the spatial distances between the collaborators. The networks of collaborators, termed `epistemic communities', should thus have a space-independent structure. This paper shows that such a notion of globalized scientific collaboration is not supported by empirical data. It introduces a novel approach of analyzing distance-dependent probabilities of collaboration. The results of the analysis of six distinct scientific fields reveal that intra-country collaboration is about 10-50 times more likely to occur than international collaboration. Moreover, strong dependencies exist between collaboration activity (measured in co-authorships) and spatial distance when confined to national borders. However, the fact that distance becomes irrelevant once collaboration is taken to the international scale suggests a globalized science system that is strongly influenced by the gravity of local science clusters. The similarity of the probability functions of the six science fields analyzed suggests a universal mode of spatial governance that is independent from the mode of knowledge creation in science.

During the growth of a network, preferential attachment shifts from (local) degree centrality to betweenness centrality as a global measure. An interpretation is that supervisors of PhD projects and postdocs broker between new entrants and the already existing network, and thus become focal to preferential attachment. Because of this mediation, scholarly networks can be expected to develop differently from networks which are predicated on preferential attachment to nodes with high degree centrality.

The results reveal that most publications in, and citations to, all five quality based strata of journals examined come from scientifically and economically advanced countries. Nevertheless, in proportion to their total number of citations given to WoS journals, it seems that less developed countries cite high-quality journals at the same rate as developed countries and so the poorer publishing of less developed countries does not seem to be due to a lack of access to top journals. Moreover, examining the publishing and citing trends of countries revealed a decreasing rate of high-income and Scientifically Advanced Countries (SACs) publications in, and citations to, all quality ranges of journals in comparison to the increasing rate of publications and citations of other groups. Finally, research cooperation between developed and less developed countries seems to positively influence the publishing behaviour of the latter as their publications co-authored with developed countries were published more often in top journals.

Moreover, the analyses were only performed for the burden diseases cause in high income countries. We investigated whether the conclusions about the relationship between burden and funding still holds when (1) including diseases of poverty and (2) accounting for the burden of diseases in low income countries. We found that the relationship between the burden and the level of diseases specific funding decreases for people living in low income countries. We find the best predictor for the level of funding to be the mortality in high income countries. In contrast to previous studies, we were able to include more diseases into our analyses (74). This enabled us to discover differences in funding levels between and within groups of diseases. we found that research on cancers was over funded with respect to the associated burden. In contrast, diseases of poverty systematically receive less funding than would be expected based on their burden. Other groups of diseases (cardiovascular diseases and mental illnesses) contained both over and under funded diseases. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

To validate the method, NSI was calculated for five citation networks and was compared with the peer review grades for the relevancy between the source and the target articles. The results showed a significant correlation between the NSI ranks and those of peer review. Also, combined linkage (CL) and weighted direct citation (WDC) were calculated from the same data. According to the results of comparison between the NSI with other similarity measures, in most cases, NSI did better than others at reproducing the peer rankings. Our principal conclusion is that the NSI can be used to prioritize the citations of given highly cited article, and represent knowledge flow from the target article. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Statistical significance tests are highly controversial and numerous criticisms have been leveled against their use. Based on examples from articles by proponents of the use statistical significance tests in research assessments, we address some of the numerous problems with such tests. The issues specifically discussed are the ritual practice of such tests, their dichotomous application in decision making, the difference between statistical and substantive significance, the implausibility of most null hypotheses, the crucial assumption of randomness, as well as the utility of standard errors and confidence intervals for inferential purposes. We argue that applying statistical significance tests and mechanically adhering to their results are highly problematic and detrimental to critical thinking. We claim that the use of such tests do not provide any advantages in relation to deciding whether differences between citation indicators are important or not. On the contrary their use may be harmful. Like many other critics, we generally believe that statistical significance tests are over- and misused in the empirical sciences including scientometrics and we encourage a reform on these matters.

The methodology consisted in building citation networks using the Journal Citation Reports (R) database, in which the nodes were journals and edges were established based on citations among journals. The overall network for the 11-year period (1999-2009) studied was small-world and followed a power-law with exponential cutoff distribution with regard to the in-strength. Upon visualizing the network topology an overall structure of the various science fields could be inferred, especially their interconnections. We confirmed quantitatively that science fields are becoming increasingly interdisciplinary, with the degree of interdisplinarity (i.e. entropy) correlating strongly with the in-strength of journals and with the impact factor.

While publications and their citations are popular indicators of academic productivity, there has been no rigorous way to quantify co-authors' relative contributions. This has seriously compromised quantitative studies on the relationship between academic productivity and research funding. Here we apply an axiomatic approach and associated bibliometric measures to revisit a recent study by Ginther et al. (Ginther et al., 2011a,b) in which the probability of receiving a U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) R01 award was analyzed with respect to the applicant's race/ethnicity. Our results provide new insight and suggest that there is no significant racial bias in the NIH review process, in contrast to the conclusion from the study by D. K. Ginther et al. Our axiomatic approach has a potential to be widely used for scientific assessment and management. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The results show statistically significant differences in acceptance rates by discipline, country affiliation of the editor, and number of reviewers per article. Negative correlations are found between acceptance rates and citation-based indicators. Positive correlations are found with journal age. These relationships are most pronounced in the most selective journals and vary by discipline.

We conducted a web survey of 1066 authors randomly selected from four disciplines in the Web of Knowledge: economics, anthropology, water resources and biochemistry (approximately 250 from each discipline). Authors were asked questions about publishing norms within their discipline. The h-index of authors was subsequently calculated from data available from the Web of Knowledge. Authors in biochemistry had on average twice the h-index of those in economics, anthropology and water resources. Biochemists had higher expectations about the number of articles published for hire and promotion, more strongly valued interdisciplinary publishing, felt the cutting edge of their science was clearer, and had more defined patterns of author credit assignment than the other disciplines. Anthropologists exhibited a lower relationship between h-index and the number of years since their first publication. We conclude that attitudinal differences between disciplines may lead to differences in the recognition of scientific findings and the therefore the establishment of normal science.

In this paper, we investigate the structure and the success of interdisciplinary scientific research teams. We examine the assembly factors using a sample of 1103 grant proposals submitted to two National Science Foundation interdisciplinary initiatives during a 3-year period, including both awarded and non-awarded proposals. The results indicate that individuals’ likelihood of collaboration on a proposal is higher among those with longer tenure, lower institutional tier, lower H-index, and with higher levels of prior co-authorship and citation relationships. However, successful proposals have a little bit different relational patterns: individuals’ likelihood of collaboration is higher among those with lower institutional tier, lower H-index, (female) gender, higher levels of prior co-authorship, but with lower levels of prior citation relationships.},

This is no surprise given the amount of money invested annually in R\&D.

The large majority of NPO revenues are devoted to the remaining landscape of altruistic causes – those not relying as heavily on scientific inquiry. Given this broader context, one might reasonably expect the non-profit world to have been as well characterized as that of scientific research. The unfortunate truth is that no map of altruistic missions and causes exists; the landscape of altruistic activity is virtually unknown. In this paper, we present the first maps of altruistic mission space. These maps were created using the text from websites of 125,000 non-profit organizations (NPOs) in the US. The maps consist of 357 topics covering areas such as religion, education, sports, culture, human services, public policy and medical care. The role of science in this altruistic landscape is examined. Possible applications are discussed.},

The investigation of the distribution of the overlaps provides useful insights on the dynamics of the general system, that is whether it converges toward a unique disciplinary structure or to a differentiated pattern. We illustrate the usefulness of the approach by investigating the dynamics of disciplinary profiles of European countries from 1996 to 2011. We analyze several bibliometric indicators (including publications and citations) of European countries in the 27 Scopus subject categories. We compare the disciplinary profiles of European countries (i) among them; (ii) with respect to the European standard; and (iii) to the World reference. We find that there is a convergence toward a unique European disciplinary profile of the scientific production even if large differences in the scientific profiles still remain. The investigation of the dynamics by year shows that developing countries are converging toward the European model while some developed countries are departing from it.},

This information can be used as the basis for decision-making about organizational adjustment; (2) congestion and directional congestion occurs in several biological institutes.

	abstract = {Equalizing bias (EqB) is a systematic inaccuracy which arises when authorship credit is divided equally among coauthors who have not contributed equally. As the number of coauthors increases, the diminishing amount of credit allocated to each additional coauthor is increasingly composed of equalizing bias such that when the total number of coauthors exceeds 12, the credit score of most coauthors is composed mostly of EqB. In general, EqB reverses the byline hierarchy and skews bibliometric assessments by underestimating the contribution of primary authors, i.e. those adversely affected by negative EqB, and overestimating the contribution of secondary authors, those benefitting from positive EqB. The positive and negative effects of EqB are balanced and sum to zero, but are not symmetrical. The lack of symmetry exacerbates the relative effects of EqB, and explains why primary authors are increasingly outnumbered by secondary authors as the number of coauthors increases. Specifically, for a paper with 50 coauthors, the benefit of positive EqB goes to 39 secondary authors while the burden of negative EqB befalls 11 primary authors. Relative to harmonic estimates of their actual contribution, the EqB of the 50 coauthors ranged from {\textless}−90\% to {\textgreater}350\%. Senior authorship, when it occurs, is conventionally indicated by a corresponding last author and recognized as being on a par with a first author. If senior authorship is not recognized, then the credit lost by an unrecognized senior author is distributed among the other coauthors as part of their EqB. The powerful distortional effect of EqB is compounded in bibliometric indices and performance rankings derived from biased equal credit. Equalizing bias must therefore be corrected at the source by ensuring accurate accreditation of all coauthors prior to the calculation of aggregate publication metrics.},

The current study seeks to answer this question with a comprehensive dataset (about 100,000 records) from very disparate sources (F1000, Altmetric, and an in-house database based on Web of Science). In the F1000 peer review system, experts attach particular tags to scientific papers which indicate whether a paper could be of interest for science or rather for other segments of society. The results show that papers with the tag “good for teaching” do achieve higher altmetric counts than papers without this tag – if the quality of the papers is controlled. At the same time, a higher citation count is shown especially by papers with a tag that is specifically scientifically oriented (“new finding”). The findings indicate that papers tailored for a readership outside the area of research should lead to societal impact. If altmetric data is to be used for the measurement of societal impact, the question arises of its normalization. In bibliometrics, citations are normalized for the papers’ subject area and publication year. This study has taken a second analytic step involving a possible normalization of altmetric data. As the results show there are particular scientific topics which are of especial interest for a wide audience. Since these more or less interesting topics are not completely reflected in Thomson Reuters’ journal sets, a normalization of altmetric data should not be based on the level of subject categories, but on the level of topics.},

This article fits discrete versions of the power law, the lognormal distribution and the hooked power law to 20 different Scopus categories, using citations to articles published in 2004 and ignoring uncited articles. The results show that, despite its popularity, the power law is not a suitable model for collections of articles from a single subject and year, even for the purpose of estimating the slope of the tail of the citation data. Both the hooked power law and the lognormal distributions fit best for some subjects but neither is a universal optimal choice and parameter estimates for both seem to be unreliable. Hence only the hooked power law and discrete lognormal distributions should be considered for subject-and-year-based citation analysis in future and parameter estimates should always be interpreted cautiously.},

Similarities among journals are evaluated using multidimensional scaling with hierarchical cluster analysis and Principal Component Analysis. The resulting visualizations and groupings reveal clusters that align with the discipline assignments for the journals for four of the six disciplines, but also greater overlaps among some journals for two of the disciplines or categorizations that do not necessarily align with their assigned disciplines. Some journals categorized into a single given discipline were found to be more closely aligned with other disciplines and some journals assigned to multiple disciplines more closely aligned with only one of the assigned disciplines.

Whether one agrees with the different factors proposed to explain the phenomenon, it is worthwhile to verify if comparing the performance within each gender, rather than without distinction, gives significantly different ranking lists. If there were some structural factor that determined a penalty in performance of female researchers compared to their male peers, then under conditions of equal capacities of men and women, any comparative evaluations of individual performance that fail to account for gender differences would lead to distortion of the judgments in favor of men. In this work we measure the extent of differences in rank between the two methods of comparing performance in each field of the hard sciences: for professors in the Italian university system, we compare the distributions of research performance for men and women and subsequently the ranking lists with and without distinction by gender.

What are the suitable quantitative indicators to measure the diversity of a researcher's scientific career? We propose two entropy-based metrics to measure a researcher's choice of research topics. Experiments with large computer science bibliographic dataset reveal that there is a strong correlation between the diversity of the career of a researcher and her success in scientific research in terms of the number of citations. We observe that while most of the researchers are biased toward either adopting diverse research fields or concentrating on very few fields, a majority of the prominent researchers tend to follow a typical “scatter-gather” policy – although their entire careers are immensely diverse with different types of fields selected at different time periods, they remain focused primarily in at most one or two fields at any particular time point of their career. Finally, we propose a stochastic model which, quite accurately, mimics the notion of field selection process observed in the real publication dataset.},

	abstract = {We study the problem of normalizing citation impact indicators for differences in citation practices across scientific fields. Normalization of citation impact indicators is usually done based on a field classification system. In practice, the Web of Science journal subject categories are often used for this purpose. However, many of these subject categories have a quite broad scope and are not sufficiently homogeneous in terms of citation practices. As an alternative, we propose to work with algorithmically constructed classification systems. We construct these classification systems by performing a large-scale clustering of publications based on their citation relations. In our analysis, 12 classification systems are constructed, each at a different granularity level. The number of fields in these systems ranges from 390 to 73,205 in granularity levels 1–12. This contrasts with the 236 subject categories in the WoS classification system. Based on an investigation of some key characteristics of the 12 classification systems, we argue that working with a few thousand fields may be an optimal choice. We then study the effect of the choice of a classification system on the citation impact of the 500 universities included in the 2013 edition of the CWTS Leiden Ranking. We consider both the MNCS and the PPtop10\% indicator. Globally, for all the universities taken together citation impact indicators generally turn out to be relatively insensitive to the choice of a classification system. Nevertheless, for individual universities, we sometimes observe substantial differences between indicators normalized based on the journal subject categories and indicators normalized based on an appropriately chosen algorithmically constructed classification system.},

This paper analyses the structure of co-authorship networks in three different fields (Nanoscience, Pharmacology and Statistics) in Spain over a three-year period (2006–2008) and explores the relationship between the research performance of scientists and their position in co-authorship networks. A denser co-authorship network is found in the two experimental fields than in Statistics, where the network is of a less connected and more fragmented nature. Using the g-index as a proxy for individual research performance, a Poisson regression model is used to explore how performance is related to different co-authorship network measures and to disclose interfield differences. The number of co-authors (degree centrality) and the strength of links show a positive relationship with the g-index in the three fields. Local cohesion presents a negative relationship with the g-index in the two experimental fields, where open networks and the diversity of co-authors seem to be beneficial. No clear advantages from intermediary positions (high betweenness) or from being linked to well-connected authors (high eigenvector) can be inferred from this analysis. In terms of g-index, the benefits derived by authors from their position in co-authorship networks are larger in the two experimental fields than in the theoretical one.},

One important aspect in this study is giving accurate definitions of the indicators for measuring uncited papers, uncited authors and uncited topics. It is found that for the period 1991–2010 ratios of uncited papers fluctuate within the interval [0,0.1]. This ratio is relatively stable and not very high. Comparison of average number of pages, average number of references, average number of authors per paper and percentage of single-authored papers between cited and uncited papers shows that no matter the journal, the first three indicators’ values for uncited papers are lower, while the values of the fourth indicator are higher, than the corresponding values for cited papers. The fact that almost all uncited authors in a journal published only one paper in this journal illustrates that a journal's uncited authors are the least productive authors in this journal. Yet, productive and highly cited authors also publish uncited papers. As to why some topics fall into the group of uncited topics, the hypothesis is that the combination of unfamiliar keywords forms an unfamiliar topic, a topic authors have elected not to study further. Another assumption is that some uncited topics fall outside the field of Library and Information Science. Retrieval results in the Web of Science for a set of uncited keywords and keyword combinations support this assumption.},

We find that the JIF has a larger influence on the citation impact of a publication than the quality (measured by judgments of peers). However, the number of pages and the quality of the references are less influential. The influence of JIF peaks after three years and then declines (in most regression analyses), but remains higher than the influence of quality judgments even after ten years. These results call into question a discrepancy between the algorithmically based indicators and the qualitative judgments by experts. The latter seems less predictive for future citation than a combination of algorithmic constructs. The results of this study can contribute to the empirical specification of the relevance of a normative versus a constructivist theory of citation.},

	abstract = {A fundamental problem in citation analysis is the prediction of the long-term citation impact of recent publications. We propose a model to predict a probability distribution for the future number of citations of a publication. Two predictors are used: the impact factor of the journal in which a publication has appeared and the number of citations a publication has received one year after its appearance. The proposed model is based on quantile regression. We employ the model to predict the future number of citations of a large set of publications in the field of physics. Our analysis shows that both predictors (i.e., impact factor and early citations) contribute to the accurate prediction of long-term citation impact. We also analytically study the behavior of the quantile regression coefficients for high quantiles of the distribution of citations. This is done by linking the quantile regression approach to a quantile estimation technique from extreme value theory. Our work provides insight into the influence of the impact factor and early citations on the long-term citation impact of a publication, and it takes a step toward a methodology that can be used to assess research institutions based on their most recently published work.},

In this work, we try to determine the influencing factors of emerging scientific topics during their early development stage. Documents in five pre-defined fields are analyzed with regard to the characteristics of the involved authors, their references and journals. With the help of an assignment to emerging and established topics, the publication behavior of documents in different development stages can be compared. Foremost, indicators can be derived that can help to identify publications in emerging topics in science at an early-stage after publication. The results show that the field differences are so pronounced that they hamper generalization. The field specific analysis, however, suggests that at least for some fields a pre-selection of emerging topics can be made. In technical fields, the involvement of larger groups of researchers is an apparent feature, while in medicine a contrary observation could be made. In addition, for the field of engineering we found that emerging topics are more often published in older but smaller journals, which indicates a high specialization of the publications.},

Consequently, the attention that can be devoted to individual papers, measured by their citation counts, is bound to decay rapidly. In this work we make a thorough study of the life-cycle of papers in different disciplines. Typically, the citation rate of a paper increases up to a few years after its publication, reaches a peak and then decreases rapidly. This decay can be described by an exponential or a power law behavior, as in ultradiffusive processes, with exponential fitting better than power law for the majority of cases. The decay is also becoming faster over the years, signaling that nowadays papers are forgotten more quickly. However, when time is counted in terms of the number of published papers, the rate of decay of citations is fairly independent of the period considered. This indicates that the attention of scholars depends on the number of published items, and not on real time.},

We discuss the connection between field normalization and the choice of a counting method for handling publications with multiple co-authors. Our focus is on the choice between full counting and fractional counting. Based on an extensive theoretical and empirical analysis, we argue that properly field-normalized results cannot be obtained when full counting is used. Fractional counting does provide results that are properly field normalized. We therefore recommend the use of fractional counting in bibliometric studies that require field normalization, especially in studies at the level of countries and research organizations. We also compare different variants of fractional counting. In general, it seems best to use either the author-level or the address-level variant of fractional counting.},

In the conceptual part, we establish that one shortcoming of the full counting method is its incompatibility with the use of additively decomposable citation impact indicators. In the empirical part of the paper, we study the consequences of adopting the address-line fractional or multiplicative counting methods. For this purpose, we use a Web of Science dataset consisting of 3.6 million articles published in the 2005–2008 period, and classified into 5119 clusters. Our research units are the 500 universities in the 2013 edition of the CWTS Leiden Ranking. Citation impact is measured using the Mean Normalized Citation Score, and the Top 10\% indicators. The main findings are the following. Firstly, although a change of counting methods alters co-authorship and citation impact patterns, cardinal differences between co-authorship rates and between citation impact values are generally small. Nevertheless, such small differences generate considerable re-rankings between universities. Secondly, the universities that are more favored by the adoption of a fractional rather than a multiplicative approach are those with a large co-authorship rate for the citation distribution as a whole, a small co-authorship rate in the upper tail of this distribution, a large citation impact performance, and a large number of solo publications.},

Our study shows that the average total number of publication is slightly higher for men than for women. Excluding the “other” group of publications from the analyses reveals that there is a negligible difference between men and women in terms of published articles. A substantial proportion of women is on maternity leave during the time period analysed and thus we would expect their productivity to be considerably lower. Similarly, we have found very little difference between the citation impact of men and women. We find matching methods to be a promising set of methods for evaluating productivity and impact of individuals from various sub-fields, universities and time periods as we are able to discard some of the underlying factors determining the results of analyses of gender differences in productivity and citation impact.},

Our analysis shows that (1) HEIs growth is largely proportional to their size, leading to a nearly log-normal distribution of size (Gibrat's law), even if small institutions tend to grow faster; (2) the growth of the number of students and HEI's reputation level positively influences HEI growth. Consequently (3) small HEIs need a lower level of reputation and less growth of students to continue growing over time, while only highly reputed HEIs are able to maintain a large size over time. Our results are relevant to understand the extent to which cumulative effects lead to a lasting concentration of resources in the HE system and whether public policies are able to redistribute resources based on merit.},

In this context, how to identify the representative work for individual researcher is an important yet uneasy problem. Addressing it will help policy makers better evaluate the achievement and potential of researchers. So far, the representative work of a researcher is usually selected as his/her most highly cited paper or the paper published in top journals. Here, we consider the representative work of a scientist as an important paper in his/her area of expertise. Accordingly, we propose a self-avoiding preferential diffusion process to generate personalized ranking of papers for each scientist and identify their representative works. The citation data from American Physical Society (APS) are used to validate our method. We find that the self-avoiding preferential diffusion method can rank the Nobel prize winning paper in each Nobel laureate's personal ranking list higher than the citation count and PageRank methods, indicating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, the robustness analysis shows that our method can highly rank the representative papers of scientists even if partial citation data are available or spurious behaviors exist. The method is finally applied to revealing the research patterns (i.e. consistency-oriented or diversity-oriented) of different scientists, institutes and countries.},

	abstract = {Many different citation-based indicators are used by researchers and research evaluators to help evaluate the impact of scholarly outputs. Although the appropriateness of individual citation indicators depends in part on the statistical properties of citation counts, there is no universally agreed best-fitting statistical distribution against which to check them. The two current leading candidates are the discretised lognormal and the hooked or shifted power law. These have been mainly tested on sets of articles from a single field and year but these collections can include multiple specialisms that might dilute their properties. This article fits statistical distributions to 50 large subject-specific journals in the belief that individual journals can be purer than subject categories and may therefore give clearer findings. The results show that in most cases the discretised lognormal fits significantly better than the hooked power law, reversing previous findings for entire subcategories. This suggests that the discretised lognormal is the more appropriate distribution for modelling pure citation data. Thus, future analytical investigations of the properties of citation indicators can use the lognormal distribution to analyse their basic properties. This article also includes improved software for fitting the hooked power law.},

A deeper understanding of the citation characteristics of book publications is needed before specific bibliometric indicators can be developed. In this study, the characteristics of citation distribution concentration in journal and book literature in Web of Science Core Collection (WoS), and the differences of these characteristics across fields, levels of aggregation and citation periods were probed to determine possible applications of this new data source for bibliometric studies. Even though the aggregation scheme is not sound for evaluation practices in books, aggregation matters much more for edited books in the sciences than for those in the social sciences and humanities. Journal articles have the least concentrated citation distribution in the sciences, while books play a more important role than other document types in the humanities. In the social sciences, both edited books and authored books have citation concentration distribution similar to journal articles. In addition, the Leimkuhler curves showed that citation window length (3 years vs. 9 years) does not affect the citation concentrations of most document types in journal and book literature significantly.},

Much less attention has been paid to the construction of these networks. We point out that different approaches can be taken to construct a bibliometric network. Normally the full counting approach is used, but we propose an alternative fractional counting approach. The basic idea of the fractional counting approach is that each action, such as co-authoring or citing a publication, should have equal weight, regardless of for instance the number of authors, citations, or references of a publication. We present two empirical analyses in which the full and fractional counting approaches yield very different results. These analyses deal with co-authorship networks of universities and bibliographic coupling networks of journals. Based on theoretical considerations and on the empirical analyses, we conclude that for many purposes the fractional counting approach is preferable over the full counting one.},

Since no central indexing or standardized metadata exists for identifying hybrid OA an explorative bottom-up methodological approach was developed. The individual search and filtering features of each publisher website and a-priori availability of data were leveraged to the extent possible. The results indicate a strong sustained growth in the volume of articles published as hybrid OA during 2007 (666 articles) to 2013 (13994 articles). The share of hybrid articles was at 3.8\% of total published articles for the period of 2011–2013 for journals with at least one identified hybrid OA article. Journals within the Scopus discipline categorization of Health and Life Sciences, in particular the field of Medicine, were found to be among the most frequent publishers of hybrid OA content. The study surfaces the many methodological challenges involved in obtaining metrics regarding hybrid OA, a growing business for journal publishers as science policy pressures for reduced access barriers to research publications.},

Drawing samples that are too small may make it difficult or impossible for studies to achieve their goals, while drawing samples that are too large may drain resources that could be better used for other purposes. This paper considers three common situations and offers advice for dealing with each. First, an entire population of records is available for an institution. We argue that, even though all records have been collected, the use of inferential statistics, significance testing, and confidence intervals is both common and desirable. Second, because of limited resources or other factors, a sample of records needs to be drawn. We demonstrate how power analyses can be used to determine in advance how large the sample needs to be to achieve the study's goals. Third, the sample size may already be determined, either because the data have already been collected or because resources are limited. We show how power analyses can again be used to determine how large effects need to be in order to find effects that are statistically significant. Such information can then help bibliometricians to develop reasonable expectations as to what their analysis can accomplish. While we focus on issues of interest to bibliometricians, our recommendations and procedures can easily be adapted for other fields of study.},

	abstract = {A number of bibliometric studies have shown that many factors impact citation counts besides the scientific quality. This paper used a large bibliometric dataset to investigate the impact of the different statistical properties of author-selected keywords and the network attributes of their co-occurrence networks on citation counts. Four statistical properties of author-selected keywords were considered: (i) Keyword growth (i.e., the relative increase or decrease in the presence statistics of an underlying keyword over a given period of time); (ii) Keyword diversity (i.e., the level of variety in a set of author-selected keywords); (iii) Number of keywords; and (iv) Percentage of new keywords. This study also considered network centrality which is a network attribute from the keyword co-occurrence network. Network centrality was calculated using the average of three basic network centrality measures: degree, closeness and betweenness centrality. A correlation and regression analysis showed that all of these factors had a significant positive relation with citation counts except the percentage of new keywords that had a significant negative relation. However, when the effect of four potential control variables (i.e., the number of article authors, the length of an article, the quality of the journal in which the article was published and the length of the title of an article) were controlled, only four variables related to author-selected keywords showed a significant relation with citation counts. Keyword growth, number of keywords and network centrality showed a positive relation with citation counts; whereas, the percentage of new keywords showed a negative relation with citation counts. The implications of these findings are discussed in this article.},

As a possible solution to this, we propose a list of intellectual activities and logistic support activities that might be involved in the production of a research paper. We then develop a quantitative approach to estimate an author’s relative intellectual contribution to a published work. An author’s relative intellectual contribution is calculated as the percent contribution of an author to each intellectual activity involved in the production of the paper multiplied by a weighing factor for each intellectual activity. The relative intellectual contribution calculated in this way can be used to determine the position of an author in the author list of a paper. Second, a corrected citation index for each author, called the T-index, can be calculated by multiplying the relative intellectual contribution by the total citations received by a paper. The proposed approach can be used to measure the impact of an author of a multi-authored paper in a more accurate way than either giving each author full credit or dividing credit equally. Our proposal not only resolves the long standing concern for the fair distribution of each author’s credit depending on his/her contribution, but it will also, hopefully, discourage addition of non-contributing authors to a paper.},

Accepting that guarantorship implies in some way acknowledgement of a prominent role on the part of the collaborating institutions, and that this recognition will be more important the more important the collaborating institutions, the paper describes two approaches to measuring this acknowledgement and discusses their effectiveness in helping to recognize prominent scientific actors by using a case study in the Library and Information Science field.

Unsurprisingly, most of bibliometric databases have a strong lack of directly available information by gender. Although empirical-based network approaches are often used in the study of research collaboration, the studies about the influence of gender dissimilarities on the resulting topological outcomes are still scarce. Here, networks of scientific subjects are used to characterize patterns that might be associated to five categories of authorships which were built based on gender. We find enough evidence that gender imbalance in scientific authorships brings a peculiar trait to the networks induced from papers published in Web of Science (WoS) indexed journals of Economics over the period 2010–2015 and having at least one author affiliated to a Portuguese institution. Our results show the emergence of a specific pattern when the network of co-occurring subjects is induced from a set of papers exclusively authored by men. Such a male-exclusive authorship condition is found to be the solely responsible for the emergence of that particular shape in the network structure. This peculiar trait might facilitate future network analysis of research collaboration and interdisciplinarity.},

Overall, compared with Twitter, Weibo altmetrics present similar distributions, with some minor variations. To better understand how and why Weibo users discuss global scientific articles, the top weiboed articles, sources and disciplines are identified and further explored. Our content analysis shows that the common motivation of scientific weibos is to disseminate or discuss the articles because they are interesting, surprising, academically useful or practically useful. Conclusion of articles is the most frequently mentioned element in scientific weibos. In addition, different from Twitter, Weibo users have a preference for traditional prestigious journals.},

A solution is needed, therefore, whereby researchers can identify information dissemination pathways in order to both access and contribute to an existing body of knowledge. In this study, we present a system to recommend scholarly venues rated in terms of relevance to a given researcher’s current scholarly pursuits and interests. We collected our data from an academic social network and modeled researchers’ scholarly reading behavior in order to propose a new and adaptive implicit rating technique for venues. We present a way to recommend relevant, specialized scholarly venues using these implicit ratings that can provide quick results, even for new researchers without a publication history and for emerging scholarly venues that do not yet have an impact factor. We performed a large-scale experiment with real data to evaluate the current scholarly recommendation system and showed that our proposed system achieves better results than the baseline. The results provide important up-to-the-minute signals that compared with post-publication usage-based metrics represent a closer reflection of a researcher’s interests.},

	abstract = {Science is becoming increasingly more interdisciplinary, giving rise to more diversity in the areas of expertise. In such a complex environment, the participation of authors became more specialized, hampering the task of evaluating authors according to their contributions. While some metrics were adapted to account for the order (or rank) of authors in a paper, many journals are now requiring a description of their specific roles in the publication. Surprisingly, the investigation of the relationships between credited contributions and author's rank has been limited to a few studies. Here we analyzed such a kind of data and show, quantitatively, that the regularity in the authorship contributions decreases with the number of authors in a paper. Furthermore, we found that the rank of authors and their roles in papers follow three general patterns according to the nature of their contributions: (i) the total contribution increases with author's rank; (ii) the total contribution decreases with author's rank; and (iii) the total contribution is symmetric, with most of contributions being performed by first and last authors. This was accomplished by collecting and analyzing the data retrieved from PLoS One and by devising a measurement of the effective number of authors in a paper. The analysis of such patterns confirms that some aspects of the author ranking are in accordance with the expected convention, such as the first and last authors being more likely to contribute more diversely in a scientific work. Conversely, such analysis also revealed that authors in the intermediary positions of the rank contribute more in specific roles, such as collecting data. This indicates that the an unbiased evaluation of researchers must take into account the distinct types of scientific contributions.},

In econometrics, the question is usually examined using data envelopment analysis. Alternatively, in this paper we propose using a statistical approach, Bayesian stochastic frontier analysis (B-SFA), that explicitly considers the stochastic nature of (count) data. The Austrian Science Fund (FWF) made data available to us from their peer review process (ex-ante peer evaluation of proposals, final research product reports) and bibliometric data. The data analysis was done for a subsample of N=1,046 FWF-funded projects (in Life Science and Medicine, Formal and Physical Sciences). For two outcome variables, a general latent research product dimension (CFACTOR) and the total number of publications (P), technical efficiency values (TE) were estimated for each project using the SFA production functions. The TE values for CFACTOR and P were on average 0.86 and 0.27, as compared with a maximum TE value of 1.0. With regard to CFACTOR, female PIs, younger PIs, and projects with longer durations have slightly higher TE than male PIs, older PIs, and projects with shorter durations. A simulation study showed the statistical behavior of the procedure under different sampling conditions.},

Based on the underlying logics of the arguments I have arranged the arguments in four groups. Group 1 focuses on arguments related to what an indicator measures, Group 2 on the additivity of a counting method, Group 3 on pragmatic reasons for the choice of counting method, and Group 4 on an indicator’s influence on the research community or how it is perceived by researchers.

Our results show that research performance differences among universities mainly stem from size, disciplinary orientation and country location. This suggests that simple global benchmarking can be misleading; rather, benchmarking is most meaningful between universities of a similar size supplemented with contextual information on a university's specific mission, orientation and national institutions.},

Results of the survey show that citation data and perceived impact do not align well, unless one properly accounts for psychological biases that affect the opinions of experts with respect to their own papers vs. those of others. Researchers tend to prefer their own publications to the most cited papers in their field of research. There is only a mild positive correlation between the number of citations of top-cited papers and expert preference in pairwise comparisons. This also applies to pairs of papers with several orders of magnitude differences in their total number of accumulated citations. However, when researchers were asked to choose among pairs of their own papers, thus eliminating the bias favouring one's own papers over those of others, they did systematically prefer the most cited article. We conclude that, when scientists have full information and are making unbiased choices, expert opinion on impact is congruent with citation numbers.},

In bibliometric studies, the age of scientific authors is generally missing; however, the year of the first publication is frequently considered as a proxy of the age of researchers. In this article, we investigate what are the most important bibibliometric factors that can be used to predict the age of researchers (birth and PhD age). Using a dataset of 3574 researchers from Québec for whom their Web of Science publications, year of birth and year of their PhD are known, our analysis falls under the linear regression setting and focuses on investigating the predictive power of various regression models rather than data fitting, considering also a breakdown by fields. The year of first publication proves to be the best linear predictor for the age of researchers. When using simple linear regression models, predicting birth and PhD years result in an error of about 3.7 years and 3.9 years, respectively. Including other bibliometric data marginally improves the predictive power of the regression models. A validation analysis for the field breakdown shows that the average length of the prediction intervals vary from 2.5 years for Basic Medical Sciences (for birth years) up to almost 10 years for Education (for PhD years). The average models perform significantly better than the models using individual observations. Nonetheless, the high variability of data and the uncertainty inherited by the models advice to caution when using linear regression models for predicting the age of researchers.},

According to Butler, the policy stimulated researchers to publish more but at the same time less good papers, resulting in lower total impact of Australian research compared to other countries. We redo and extend the analysis using longer time series, and show that Butlers’ main conclusions are not correct. We conclude in this paper (i) that the currently available data reject Butler’s claim that “journal publication productivity has increased significantly… but its impact has declined”, and (ii) that it is hard to find such evidence also with a reconstruction of her data. On the contrary, after implementing evaluation systems and performance based funding, Australia not only improved its share of research output but also increased research quality, implying that total impact was greatly increased. Our findings show that if output based research funding has an effect on research quality, it is positive and not negative. This finding has implications for the discussions about research evaluation and about assumed perverse effects of incentives, as in those debates the Australian case plays a major role.},

We assign over \$203 billion of project-level funding data from STAR METRICS® to individual topics in science, and show that the indicator of topic prominence, explains over one-third of the variance in current (or future) funding by topic. We also show that highly prominent topics receive far more funding per researcher than topics that are not prominent.

Knowledge transfer between topics and the developing status of the major topics have been recognized, which are represented by the merging and splitting of local topics in different time periods. Results show that the evolution of a major topic usually follows a pattern from adjusting status to mature status, and sometimes with re-adjusting status in between the evolving process. Knowledge transfer happens both within a topic and among topics. Word migration via topic channels has been defined, and three migration types (non-migration, dual-migration, and multi-migration) are distinguished to facilitate better understanding of the topic evolution.},

A codebook is developed to support a content analysis of the full-text papers.

The inconsistency derives partly from the variety of citation standards currently used for software, and partly from fact that these standards are not well followed by authors on multiple levels. This work sheds light on the future development of software citation standards, especially given the present landscape of conflicting citation practices. Moreover, our approach furnishes a possible blueprint for dealing with the granularity of software entities in scientific citation: we consider citations of the core R software environment, of specific R packages, and of individual functions.},

It is particularly suitable for science mapping at a time when the emphasis on empirical contributions is producing voluminous, fragmented, and controversial research streams. Science mapping is complex and unwieldly because it is multi-step and frequently requires numerous and diverse software tools, which are not all necessarily freeware. Although automated workflows that integrate these software tools into an organized data flow are emerging, in this paper we propose a unique open-source tool, designed by the authors, called bibliometrix, for performing comprehensive science mapping analysis. bibliometrix supports a recommended workflow to perform bibliometric analyses. As it is programmed in R, the proposed tool is flexible and can be rapidly upgraded and integrated with other statistical R-packages. It is therefore useful in a constantly changing science such as bibliometrics.},

This work reveals that document types that are often excluded from citation analysis due to their lower citation values, like editorial materials, letters, news items, or meeting abstracts, are strongly covered and saved in Mendeley, suggesting that Mendeley readership can reliably inform the analysis of these document types. Findings show that collaborative papers are frequently saved in Mendeley, which is similar to what is observed for citations. The relationship between readership and the length of titles and number of pages, however, is weaker than for the same relationship observed for citations. The analysis of different disciplines also points to different patterns in the relationship between several document characteristics, readership, and citation counts. Overall, results highlight that although disciplinary differences exist, readership counts are related to similar bibliographic characteristics as those related to citation counts, reinforcing the idea that Mendeley readership and citations capture a similar concept of impact, although they cannot be considered as equivalent indicators.},

Most other Altmetric.com scores can help predict future impact in some fields. Overall, the results confirm that early Altmetric.com scores can predict later citation counts, although less well than journal impact factors, and the optimal strategy is to consider both Altmetric.com scores and journal impact factors.

A dataset of about 31 million publications, and their mutual citations relations, is used to obtain several ACPLCs of different granularity. Each ACPLC is compared to the baseline classification and the best performing ACPLC is identified. The results of two case studies show that the topics of the cases are closely associated with different classes of the identified ACPLC, and that these classes tend to treat only one topic. Further, the class size variation is moderate, and only a small proportion of the publications belong to very small classes. For these reasons, we conclude that the proposed methodology is suitable to determine the topic granularity level of an ACPLC and that the ACPLC identified by this methodology is useful for bibliometric analyses.},

We analyzed the distributive patterns of R packages in all PLoS papers, identified the top packages mentioned in these papers, and examined the clustering structure of the network.

This paper presents a novel method to approximate the specialty to which a given publication record belongs. The method partially combines sets of key values for four publication data fields: source, title, authors and references. The approach is founded in concepts defining research disciplines and scholarly communication, and in empirically observed regularities in publication data. The resulting specialty approximation consists of publications associated to the investigated publication record via key values for at least three of the four data fields. This paper describes the method and illustrates it with an application to publication records of individual scientists. The illustration also successfully tests the focus of the specialty approximation in terms of its ability to connect and help identify peers. Potential tracks for further investigation include analyses involving other kinds of specialized publication records, studies for a broader range of specialties, and exploration of the potential for diverse applications in research and research policy context.},

They can be broadly classified as intellectual and algorithmic approaches. A paper-based algorithmically constructed classification system (ACCS) was proposed which is based on citation relations. Using a few ACCS field-specific clusters, we investigate the discriminatory power of the ACCS. The micro study focusses on the topic ‘overall water splitting’ and related topics. The first part of the study investigates intellectually whether the ACCS is able to identify papers on overall water splitting reliably and validly. Next, we compare the ACCS with (1) a paper-based intellectual (INSPEC) classification and (2) a journal-based intellectual classification (Web of Science, WoS, subject categories). In the last part of our case study, we compare the average number of citations in selected ACCS clusters (on overall water splitting and related topics) with the average citation count of publications in WoS subject categories related to these clusters. The results of this micro study question the discriminatory power of the ACCS. We recommend larger follow-up studies on broad datasets.},

Furthermore, I examine which countries are the most important collaborators of cities. Finally, I identify the most productive disciplines in each city. I use GPS Visualizer to illustrate the scientometric data of nearly 2200 cities on maps. Results show that cities with the highest scientific output are mostly located in developed countries and China. Between 1986 and 2015, the greatest number of scientific articles were created in Beijing. The international hegemony of the United States in science has been described by many studies, and is also reinforced by the fact that the United States is the most important collaborator to more than 75\% of all cities. Medicine is the most productive discipline in two-thirds of cities. Furthermore, cities having the highest scientific output in specific disciplines show well-defined geographical patterns.},

This study has three objectives: a) to analyse the uptake of some of the most popular platforms (Google Scholar Citations, ResearcherID, ResearchGate, Mendeley and Twitter) by a specific scientific community (bibliometrics, scientometrics, informetrics, webometrics, and altmetrics); b) to compare the metrics available from each platform; and c) to determine the meaning of all these new metrics. To do this, the data available in these platforms about a sample of 811 authors (researchers in bibliometrics for whom a public profile Google Scholar Citations was found) were extracted. A total of 31 metrics were analysed. The results show that a high number of the analysed researchers only had a profile in Google Scholar Citations (159), or only in Google Scholar Citations and ResearchGate (142). Lastly, we find two kinds of metrics of online impact. First, metrics related to connectivity (followers), and second, all metrics associated to academic impact. This second group can further be divided into usage metrics (reads, views), and citation metrics. The results suggest that Google Scholar Citations is the source that provides more comprehensive citation-related data, whereas Twitter stands out in connectivity-related metrics.},

A broad array of actors is involved in the communication of science on Twitter, with individual citizens and individual researchers playing an important role. In principle, this is promising for creating direct interaction, which can be difficult through more traditional mass media. The vast majority of communication activities regarding academic papers is undigested dissemination with almost no sign of debate, contestation, or collective reflection. Another general finding of this study is that bot accounts play a major role in the science communication landscape on Twitter.},

To differentiate between more reliable (sustainable and legal) forms of access and less reliable ones, the data extracted from GS was combined with information available in DOAJ, CrossRef, OpenDOAR, and ROAR. This allowed us to distinguish the percentage of documents in our sample that are made OA by the publisher (23.1\%, including Gold, Hybrid, Delayed, and Bronze OA) from those available as Green OA (17.6\%), and those available from other sources (40.6\%, mainly due to ResearchGate). The data shows an overall free availability of 54.6\%, with important differences at the country and subject category levels.

Correlations between these metrics were calculated from month to month to observe the evolution of these relationships. The results showed that mention metrics (Tweets and Blog mentions) are the earliest metrics that become available most quickly and have the shortest life cycle. Next, Readers are the metrics with the highest prevalence and with the second fastest growth. Views and Downloads show a continuous growth, being the indicators with the longest life cycles. Finally, Citations are the slowest indicators and have a low prevalence. Correlations show a strong relationship between mention metrics and Readers and Downloads, and between Readers and Citations.

Using a sample of 1250 U.S. researchers in Sociology, Political Science, Economics, Cardiology and Chemistry, we examine gender differences in the average citation coverage of the two databases. We also calculate database-specific h-indices for all authors in the sample. In repeated simulations of hiring scenarios, we use these indices to examine whether women's appointment rates increase if hiring decisions rely on data from GS in lieu of WoS. We find no systematic gender differences in the citation coverage of the two databases. Further, our results indicate marginal to non-existing effects of database selection on women's success-rates in the simulations. In line with the existing literature, we find the citation coverage in WoS to be largest in Cardiology and Chemistry and smallest in Political Science and Sociology. The concordance between author-based h-indices measured by GS and WoS is largest for Chemistry followed by Cardiology, Political Science, Sociology and Economics.},

However, the problem of missing information from author addresses has not attracted sufficient attention from scholars and practitioners. This study probes the missing data problem in the three core journal citation databases of Web of Science (WoS). Our findings reveal that from 1900 to 2015 over one-fifth of the publications indexed in WoS have completely missing information from the address field. The magnitude of the problem varies greatly among time periods, citation databases, document types, and publishing languages. The problem is especially serious for research in the sciences and social sciences published before the early 1970s and remains significant for recent publications in the arts and humanities. Further examinations suggest that many records with completely missing address information do not represent scholarly research. Full-text scanning of a random sample reveals that about 40\% of the missing address articles have some address information that is not indexed in WoS. This study also finds that the problem of partially missing address information for U.S. research has diminished dramatically since 1998. The paper ends by providing some discussion and tentative remedies.},

Is one internationally oriented or is citation limited to national resources? Do the citation patterns reflect a growing differentiation between the domestic and international research enterprise? To evaluate change over time, we include natural-sciences papers published in the countries from three publication years: 2004, 2009, and 2014. The results show that articles co-authored by researchers from Germany or the Netherlands are less likely to be among the globally most highly-cited articles if they also cite “domestic” research (i.e. research authored by authors from the same country). To put this another way, less well-cited research is more likely to stand on domestic shoulders and research that becomes more highly-cited is more likely to stand on international shoulders. A possible reason for the results is that researchers “over-cite” the papers from their own country – lacking the focus on quality in citing. However, these differences between domestic and international shoulders are not visible for the UK.},

Analyzing 90,000 publications by 2500 faculty members in over 100 academic institutions from three multidisciplinary areas, information, public policy, and neuroscience, we investigated the connection between multidisciplinarity and research collaborations. Based on social network analysis and text mining, our analysis suggests that more multidisciplinary institutions are not necessarily more collaborative, although they do feature collaborations that are more interdisciplinary.

This growth has far-reaching implications for how academic knowledge is connected, accessed and evaluated. Against this background, we analyzed a citation network comprised of 837 million references produced by 32.6 million publications over the period 1965–2012, allowing for a detailed analysis of the ‘attention economy’ in science. Our results show how growth relates to ‘citation inflation’, increased connectivity in the citation network resulting from decreased levels of uncitedness, and a narrowing range of attention – as both very classic and very recent literature are being cited increasingly less. The decreasing attention to recent literature published within the last 6 years suggests that science has become stifled by a publication deluge destabilizing the balance between production and consumption. To better understand these patterns together, we developed a generative model of the citation network, featuring exponential growth, the redirection of scientific attention via publications’ reference lists, and the crowding out of old literature by the new. We validate our model against several empirical benchmarks, and then use perturbation analysis to measure the impact of shifts in citing behavior on the synthetic system's properties, thereby providing insights into the functionality of the science citation network as an infrastructure supporting the memory of science.},

METHOD: The historical background of this issue was investigated through a literature search. The Instructions to Authors of 122 major biomedical journals were reviewed for evidence of a policy on the retraction of articles. Editors of those journals with no mention of retraction in their Instructions to Authors were contacted by email and/or postal mail.
RESULTS: Sixty-two percent of the journals investigated did not post or report having a policy on issuing retractions. Only twenty-one (18\%) did. The remainder did not post any policy and did not respond to inquiries.
DISCUSSION: Including policies in Instructions to Authors relating to the principled conduct of research and publication will improve the ethical environment in which the scientific community works.},

Methods: Physicians' (19) encounters with patients (24) accompanied by an interpreter were videotaped. Stimulated recall was used to elicit each of the participants' perceptions of the clinical encounter. We analyzed transcriptions of the physician interviews using Atlas-ti software. Results: Physicians perceived all cornmunication tasks to be more difficult using an interpreter than when one was not needed. Physicians perceived family interpreters to be less skilled translators than professional interpreters. Physicians expected professional interpreters to serve as culture brokers at least some of the time. Although only some family interpreters were also caregivers, physicians assumed that all of them fulfilled caregiver roles. Conclusion: With professional interpreters, physicians follow communication rules they were taught. In contrast, physicians act as though these rules are not relevant with family interpreters who they treat as caregivers. Practice implications: Guidelines to working with an interpreter should include directives on working with both professional and family interpreters, describing the similarities and differences with each type, and modifying the clinical encounter process to correspond to those attributes.

	abstract = {Background. Decisional conflict is defined as personal uncertainty about which course of action to take when choice among competing options involves risk, regret, or challenge to personal life values. It is influenced by inadequate knowledge, unclear values, inadequate support, and the perception that an ineffective decision has been made. Until recently, it has been studied at the individual level, which ignores the interpersonal system between patients and physicians. Objective. To explore the effect of feeling uninformed, unclear values, inadequate support, and the perception that an ineffective decision has been made on one own's outcome (actor effect) and on the other person's outcome (partner effect). Methods. After a clinical encounter, modifiable deficits and personal uncertainty were measured in physicians and patients using the Decisional Conflict Scale. Structural equation modeling was used to measure the parameters of the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model. Results. A total of 112 dyads of physicians and patients were included in the analysis. For both patients and physicians, 2 actor effects, unclear values (P{\textless}0.0001) and the perception that an ineffective decision has been made (P{\textless}0.0001), were found to be positively correlated with personal uncertainty. One partner effect, feeling uninformed (P=0.03), was found to be negatively correlated with personal uncertainty. Conclusions. Personal uncertainty of patients and physicians is influenced not only by their respective deficits but also by the deficits of the other member of the dyad. Our results indicate that the more unclear the expression of their own values and the more they perceive that an ineffective choice had been made, the more both physicians and patients experience personal uncertainty. They also indicate that the less uninformed they feel, the more both physicians and patients experience personal uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Objective: The objective was to understand how adults living with asthma deal with their chronic illness, perceive self-management and develop self-care strategies. Methods: 24 in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted in Montreal, Canada with low- and middle-income adults living with asthma. The interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed for purposes of analysis. The analysis consisted of debriefing sessions, coding and interpretive analysis. Results: We identified 3 types of self-care strategies adopted by the participants in order to deal with asthma: (1) strategy of controlling symptoms leads to patients following the recommendations of their physician; (2) strategy of preventing symptoms involves a holistic approach to treating illness, and leads patients to prefer lay methods and alternative treatments for preventing symptoms instead of relying on medications; (3) strategy of tolerating symptoms leads people to experience aggravated symptoms and to seek emergency care. Conclusion: This study reveals that important Subjective as well social factors influence the way people deal with a chronic illness like asthma. Future research should: (1) identify the difficulties encountered by vulnerable patients in regard to treatment and care interactions: (2) provide health professionals with the right tools so that they can take into consideration the treatment perceptions and the effects of life conditions on self-management. Practice implications: Patients with asthma need comprehensive care that addresses social conditions, reluctance to take medication, exploration of lay and alternative treatment and difficulties in accessing preventive care.

	doi = {10.1002/14651858.CD004398.pub3},
	abstract = {Background Printed educational materials are widely used passive dissemination strategies to improve the quality of clinical practice and patient outcomes. Traditionally they are presented in paper formats such as monographs, publication in peer-reviewed journals and clinical guidelines. Objectives To assess the effect of printed educational materials on the practice of healthcare professionals and patient health outcomes. To explore the influence of some of the characteristics of the printed educational materials (e. g. source, content, format) on their effect on professional practice and patient outcomes. Search methods For this update, search strategies were rewritten and substantially changed from those published in the original review in order to refocus the search from published material to printed material and to expand terminology describing printed materials. Given the significant changes, all databases were searched from start date to June 2011. We searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), HealthStar, CINAHL, ERIC, CAB Abstracts, Global Health, and the EPOC Register. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised trials, controlled before and after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series (ITS) analyses that evaluated the impact of printed educational materials (PEMs) on healthcare professionals' practice or patient outcomes, or both. We included three types of comparisons: (1) PEM versus no intervention, (2) PEM versus single intervention, (3) multifaceted intervention where PEM is included versus multifaceted intervention without PEM. There was no language restriction. Any objective measure of professional practice (e. g. number of tests ordered, prescriptions for a particular drug), or patient health outcomes (e. g. blood pressure) were included. Data collection and analysis Two review authors undertook data extraction independently, and any disagreement was resolved by discussion among the review authors. For analyses, the included studies were grouped according to study design, type of outcome (professional practice or patient outcome, continuous or dichotomous) and type of comparison. For controlled trials, we reported the median effect size for each outcome within each study, the median effect size across outcomes for each study and the median of these effect sizes across studies. Where the data were available, we re-analysed the ITS studies and reported median differences in slope and in level for each outcome, across outcomes for each study, and then across studies. We categorised each PEM according to potential effects modifiers related to the source of the PEMs, the channel used for their delivery, their content, and their format. Main results The review includes 45 studies: 14 RCTs and 31 ITS studies. Almost all the included studies (44/45) compared the effectiveness of PEM to no intervention. One single study compared paper-based PEM to the same document delivered on CD-ROM. Based on seven RCTs and 54 outcomes, the median absolute risk difference in categorical practice outcomes was 0.02 when PEMs were compared to no intervention (range from 0 to +0.11). Based on three RCTs and eight outcomes, the median improvement in standardised mean difference for continuous profession practice outcomes was 0.13 when PEMs were compared to no intervention (range from -0.16 to +0.36). Only two RCTs and two ITS studies reported patient outcomes. In addition, we re-analysed 54 outcomes from 25 ITS studies, using time series regression and observed statistically significant improvement in level or in slope in 27 outcomes. From the ITS studies, we calculated improvements in professional practice outcomes across studies after PEM dissemination (standardised median change in level = 1.69). From the data gathered, we could not comment on which PEM characteristic influenced their effectiveness. Authors' conclusions The results of this review suggest that when used alone and compared to no intervention, PEMs may have a small beneficial effect on professional practice outcomes. There is insufficient information to reliably estimate the effect of PEMs on patient outcomes, and clinical significance of the observed effect sizes is not known. The effectiveness of PEMs compared to other interventions, or of PEMs as part of a multifaceted intervention, is uncertain.},

	abstract = {Background: The literature recognizes a need for greater patient involvement in health technology assessment (HTA), but few studies have been reported, especially at the local level. Following the decentralisation of HTA in Quebec, Canada, the last few years have seen the creation of HTA units in many Quebec university hospital centres. These units represent a unique opportunity for increased patient involvement in HTA at the local level. Our project will engage patients in an assessment being carried out by a local HTA team to assess alternatives to isolation and restraint for hospitalized or institutionalized adults. Our objectives are to: 1) validate a reference framework for exploring the relevance and applicability of various models of patient involvement in HTA, 2) implement strategies that involve patients (including close relatives and representatives) at different stages of the HTA process, 3) evaluate intervention processes, and 4) explore the impact of these interventions on a) the applicability and acceptability of recommendations arising from the assessment, b) patient satisfaction, and c) the sustainability of this approach in HTA. Methods: For Objective 1, we will conduct individual interviews with various stakeholders affected by the use of alternatives to isolation and restraint for hospitalized or institutionalized adults. For Objective 2, we will implement three specific strategies for patient involvement in HTA: a) direct participation in the HTA process, b) consultation of patients or their close relatives through data collection, and c) patient involvement in the dissemination of HTA results. For Objectives 3 and 4, we will evaluate the intervention processes and the impact of patient involvement strategies on the recommendations arising from the HTA and the understanding of the ethical and social implications of the HTA. Discussion: This project is likely to influence future HTA practices because it directly targets knowledge users' need for strategies that increase patient involvement in HTA. By documenting the processes and outcomes of these involvement strategies, the project will contribute to the knowledge base related to patient involvement in HTA.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE Patients who regularly see more than one clinician for health problems risk discontinuity and fragmented care. Our objective was to develop and validate a generic measure of management continuity from the patient perspective. METHODS Themes from 33 qualitative studies of patient experience with care from various clinicians were matched to existing instruments to identify potential measures and measurement gaps. Adapted and new items were tested cognitively, and the instrument was administered to 376 adult patients consulting in primary care for a variety of health conditions but seeing clinicians in a variety of settings. After initial psychometric analysis, the instrument was modified slightly and readministered after 6 months. The analysis identified reliable subscales and their association with indicators of continuity. RESULTS Observed factors correspond to 8 intended constructs, with good reliability. Three subscales (12 items) relate to the principal clinician and cover management and relational continuity. Four subscales (13 items) are related to multiple clinicians and address team relational continuity and problems with coordination and gaps in information transfer. Two (11 items) pertain to the patient's partnership in care. Subscales correlate well and in expected directions with indicators of discontinuity (wanting to change clinicians, suffering, and sense of being abandoned, medical errors) and degree of care organization. CONCLUSION The instrument reliably assesses both positive and negative dimensions of continuity of care across the entire system, and the subscales correlate with continuity effects. It supports patient-centered and relationship-based care and can be used as a whole or in part to assess coordination and continuity in primary care.},

	doi = {10.1186/1748-5908-9-24},
	abstract = {Background: Patients are increasingly seen as active partners in healthcare. While patient involvement in individual clinical decisions has been extensively studied, no trial has assessed how patients can effectively be involved in collective healthcare decisions affecting the population. The goal of this study was to test the impact of involving patients in setting healthcare improvement priorities for chronic care at the community level. Methods: Design: Cluster randomized controlled trial. Local communities were randomized in intervention (priority setting with patient involvement) and control sites (no patient involvement). Setting: Communities in a canadian region were required to set priorities for improving chronic disease management in primary care, from a list of 37 validated quality indicators. Intervention: Patients were consulted in writing, before participating in face-to-face deliberation with professionals. Control: Professionals established priorities among themselves, without patient involvement. Participants: A total of 172 individuals from six communities participated in the study, including 83 chronic disease patients, and 89 health professionals. Outcomes: The primary outcome was the level of agreement between patients' and professionals' priorities. Secondary outcomes included professionals' intention to use the selected quality indicators, and the costs of patient involvement. Results: Priorities established with patients were more aligned with core generic components of the Medical Home and Chronic Care Model, including: access to primary care, self-care support, patient participation in clinical decisions, and partnership with community organizations (p {\textless} 0.01). Priorities established by professionals alone placed more emphasis on the technical quality of single disease management. The involvement intervention fostered mutual influence between patients and professionals, which resulted in a 41\% increase in agreement on common priorities (95\%CI: + 12\% to +58\%, p {\textless} 0.01). Professionals' intention to use the selected quality indicators was similar in intervention and control sites. Patient involvement increased the costs of the prioritization process by 17\%, and required 10\% more time to reach consensus on common priorities. Conclusions: Patient involvement can change priorities driving healthcare improvement at the population level. Future research should test the generalizability of these findings to other contexts, and assess its impact on patient care.},

We evaluated the effect of DECISION+2, a shared decision-making training program, on the percentage of patients who decided to take antibiotics after consultation with a physician or resident. Methods: We performed a randomized trial, clustered at the level of family practice teaching unit, with 2 study arms: DECISION+2 and control. The DECISION+2 training program included a 2-hour online tutorial followed by a 2-hour interactive seminar about shared decision-making. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who decided to use antibiotics immediately after consultation. We also recorded patients' perception that shared decision-making had occurred. Two weeks after the initial consultation, we assessed patients' adherence to the decision, repeat consultation, decisional regret and quality of life. Results: We compared outcomes among 181 patients who consulted 77 physicians in 5 family practice teaching units in the DECISION+2 group, and 178 patients who consulted 72 physicians in 4 family practice teaching units in the control group. The percentage of patients who decided to use antibiotics after consultation was 52.2\% in the control group and 27.2\% in the DECISION+2 group (absolute difference 25.0\%, adjusted relative risk 0.48, 95\% confidence interval 0.34-0.68). DECISION+2 was associated with patients taking a more active role in decision-making (Z = 3.9, p {\textless} 0.001). Patient outcomes 2 weeks after consultation were similar in both groups. Interpretation: The shared decision-making program DECISION+2 enhanced patient participation in decision-making and led to fewer patients deciding to use antibiotics for acute respiratory infections.

	abstract = {Background: Clinical nurse specialists are recognized internationally for providing an advanced level of practice. They positively impact the delivery of healthcare services by using specialty-specific expert knowledge and skills, and integrating competencies as clinicians, educators, researchers, consultants and leaders. Graduate-level education is recommended for the role but many countries do not have formal credentialing mechanisms for clinical nurse specialists. Previous studies have found that clinical nurse specialist roles are poorly understood by stakeholders. Few national studies have examined the utilization of clinical nurse specialists. Objective: To identify the practice patterns of clinical nurse specialists in Canada. Design: A descriptive cross-sectional survey. Participants: Self-identified clinical nurse specialists in Canada. Methods: A 50-item self-report questionnaire was developed, pilot-tested in English and French, and administered to self-identified clinical nurse specialists from April 2011 to August 2011. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics and content analysis. Results: The actual number of clinical nurse specialists in Canada remains unknown. The response rate using the number of registry-identified clinical nurse specialists was 33\% (804/2431). Of this number, 608 reported working as a clinical nurse specialist. The response rate for graduate-prepared clinical nurse specialists was 60\% (471/782). The practice patterns of clinical nurse specialists varied across clinical specialties. Graduate-level education influenced their practice patterns. Few administrative structures and resources were in place to support clinical nurse specialist role development. The lack of title protection resulted in confusion around who identifies themselves as a clinical nurse specialist and consequently made it difficult to determine the number of clinical nurse specialists in Canada. Conclusions: This is the first national survey of clinical nurse specialists in Canada. A clearer understanding of these roles provides stakeholders with much needed information about clinical nurse specialist practice patterns. Such information can inform decisions about policies, education and organizational supports to effectively utilize this role in healthcare systems. This study emphasizes the need to develop standardized educational requirements, consistent role titles and credentialing mechanisms to facilitate the identification and comparison of clinical nurse specialist roles and role outcomes internationally.

	abstract = {The prevalence of chronic diseases today calls for new ways of working with patients to manage their care. Although patient-centered approaches have contributed to significant advances in care and to treatments that more fully respect patients' preferences, values, and personal experiences, the reality is that health care professionals still hold a monopoly on the role of healer. Patients live with their conditions every day and are experts when it comes to their own experiences of illness; this expertise should be welcomed, valued, and fostered by other members of the care team. The patient-as-partner approach embodies the ideal of making the patient a bona fide member of the health care team, a true partner in his or her care. Since 2010, the University of Montreal, through the Direction of Collaboration and Patient Partnership, has embraced this approach. Patients are not only active members of their own health care team but also are involved in research and provide valuable training to health sciences students. Including patients as full partners in the health care team entails a significant shift in both the medical practice and medical education cultures. In this perspective, the authors describe this innovative approach to patient care, including the conceptual framework used in its development and the main achievements of patient partners in education, health care, and research.},

	abstract = {Many health-related decisions require choosing between two options, each with risks and benefits. When presented with such tradeoffs, people often make choices that fail to align with scientific evidence or with their own values. This study tested whether risk communication and values clarification methods could help parents and guardians make evidence-based, values-congruent decisions about children's influenza vaccinations. In 2013-2014 we conducted an online 2x2 factorial experiment in which a diverse sample of U.S. parents and guardians (n = 407) were randomly assigned to view either standard information about influenza vaccines or risk communication using absolute and incremental risk formats. Participants were then either presented or not presented with an interactive values clarification interface with constrained sliders and dynamic visual feedback. Participants randomized to the risk communication condition combined with the values clarification interface were more likely to indicate intentions to vaccinate ( = 2.10, t(399) = 2.63, p {\textless} 0.01). The effect was particularly notable among participants who had previously demonstrated less interest in having their children vaccinated against influenza ( = -2.14, t(399) = -2.06, p {\textless} 0.05). When assessing vaccination status reported by participants who agreed to participate in a follow-up study six months later (n = 116), vaccination intentions significantly predicted vaccination status (OR = 1.66, 95\%CI (1.13, 2.44), p {\textless} 0.05) and rates of informed choice (OR = 1.51, 95\%CI (1.07, 2.13), p {\textless} 0.012), although there were no direct effects of experimental factors on vaccination rates. Qualitative analysis suggested that logistical barriers impeded immunization rates. Risk communication and values clarification methods may contribute to increased vaccination intentions, which may, in turn, predict vaccination status if logistical barriers are also addressed.},

This study aimed to explore the needs and expectations of persons living in poverty and healthcare professionals in terms of medical training regarding poverty and its effects on health and healthcare. Methods: We conducted a participatory action research study using photovoice, a method using photography, together with merging of knowledge and practice, an approach promoting dialogue between different sources of knowledge. Nineteen healthcare professionals and persons from an international community organization against poverty participated in the study. The first phase included 60 meetings and group sessions to identify the perceived barriers between persons living in poverty and healthcare teams. In the second phase, sub-committees deployed action plans in academic teaching units to overcome barriers identified in the first phase. Data were analysed through thematic analysis, using NVivo, in collaboration with five non-academic co-researchers. Results: Four themes in regard to medical training were highlighted: improving medical students' and residents' knowledge on poverty and the living conditions of persons living in poverty; improving their understanding of the reality of those people; improving their relational skills pertaining to communication and interaction with persons living in poverty; improving their awareness and capacity for self-reflection. At the end of the second phase, actions were undertaken such as improving knowledge of the living conditions of persons living in poverty by posting social assistance rates, and tailoring interventions to patients' reality by including sociodemographic information in electronic medical records. Our findings also led to a participatory research project aiming to improve the skills and competency of residents and health professionals in regard to the quality of healthcare provided to persons living in poverty. Conclusions: Medical training and residency programs should aim to improve students' and residents' relational skills, more specifically their communication skills, as well as their awareness and capacity for self-reflection, by helping them to identify and recognize their biases, and limitations.},

	abstract = {A bibliographic database comprising 17 604 references on biogeochemistry and disturbances in coastal ecosystems was compiled for the period 1971 to 2004 from the Aquatic Science and Fisheries Abstracts and the Web of Science databases. The coastal ocean received increased attention starting in the early 1990s, as shown by the increase in the rate of publication, both in absolute number (2-fold increase of the yearly rate) and relative to the publication rate of all disciplines (3-fold increase). The number of publications on each ecosystem type and the geographic location of study sites are not proportional to their respective surface area. By this measure, estuaries and the open continental shelf are, respectively, over- and under-investigated, and the research effort is disproportionately high in some areas (e.g. the North Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, the subjects of 41\% of the publications) and low in other areas (e.g. high-latitude coastal zones and the western Pacific). The cycling of inorganic nutrients is the biogeochemical process receiving the highest research effort (46\% of the publications). Although controversial, exchanges with the atmosphere, including CO2, have been poorly investigated, with only 1.3\% of the publications. The magnitude of scientific community publishing increased 13-fold during the period of investigation, also demonstrating the growing interest in coastal biogeochemistry and disturbances. Moreover, the lists of authors have become longer, perhaps indicating research projects wider in scope. Senior authors from 137 countries contributed papers; the EU25 and the USA contributed about. 1/3 of the publications each, The number of publications per million inhabitants is highly correlated to the gross domestic product per inhabitant, but some countries perform better (the Scandinavian countries, Australia, New Zealand and Canada) or less well (Japan, the USA and Italy) than average. The number of citations of the publications is highly variable and indicates that barriers between disciplines still exist. At least 2 specialized journals (Estuaries and Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science) are among the most relevant journals, but Marine Ecology Progress Series is the single most important source of literature in the fields of coastal biogeochemistry and disturbances. This diagnostic should be useful to the research community and funding agencies to address the present imbalances in research allocation and to steer attention to geographical areas and processes that remain poorly investigated. Only then can the role of the coastal ocean on the global biogeochemical cycles and its response to climatic and anthropogenic disturbances be clarified.},

The publication devoted to macrophytes in Neotropics increased conspicuously in the last two decades. Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and Chile were the most productive among Neotropical countries. Our analyses showed that the Studies dealt mostly with the influences of aquatic macrophytes on organisms and abiotic features.

The results of this study showed that Brazilian freshwater ichthyology publications have been increasing during the study period. This process is a consequence of a series of investments that the Brazilian Government has made. Furthermore, data analyses identified scientific areas where there was a lack of scientific knowledge (e.g. studies of species threatened with extinction and certain hydrologic basins). Research institutions from the north-east and northern region of Brazil had the lowest participation in scientific productivity, which was a reflection of their regions poorer economic situation. This study showed that scientific productivity in Brazilian ichthyology was a direct reflection of state investment in research. Furthermore, data in this study follow expected statistical probabilities, for example, fishes from the most diverse families were the most studied. Thus, the study shows that great progress has been made by Brazilian ichthyologists in the last 20 years; however, due to the mega diversity of fishes in Brazil, much remains to be done if many species are to become known to science and to be saved from extinction. This it seems will depend on continued and further investment by Brazilian Government funding agencies, as Brazilian ichthyologists have demonstrated their capacity to generate high quality information about their study species.},

To assess the contribution of the ideas Hutchinson introduced in "The Homage" to aquatic ecology research, we performed a bibliometric evaluation of all the articles that cited this paper between 1960 and 2009. The articles were retrieved using the database from Thomson Reuters (ISI Web of Knowledge) in March 2009. For each paper, we first identified the studied environment (terrestrial, marine or freshwater) and whether the study was theoretical or empirical. For marine and freshwater studies, we recorded the journal where the article was published, the year of publication, the number of citations, the taxonomic group (e.g. fish, phytoplankton, zooplankton, macroinvertebrates or macrophytes), the habitat (e.g. wetlands, lakes, rivers, streams or ocean) and the main ideas addressed. A total of 1345 articles cited "The Homage", and the number of citations increased significantly with time. Most of the articles that cited "The Homage" described research carried out in a terrestrial environment or were theoretical, and a lesser number of citations came from freshwater and marine papers, which used mainly fish and invertebrates as model organisms. In the aquatic sciences, most of the papers discussed the influences of competition and energy (productivity) on diversity. Our results indicate that "The Homage" can still be considered a "citation classic" and a breakthrough contribution, and that it is still having a great impact on different fields of ecology, including limnology and marine ecology.},

	abstract = {The marine sciences have undergone a sequence of historical changes related to new methodologies, approaches and challenges. Most recently, deteriorating natural ecosystems and threatened component species have prompted a renewed change in the focus of scientific research on the marine environment. This study analyzes the scientific literature on cetaceans during the period 2005-2008 to demonstrate that a key focus of modern research is on conservation-related topics, and then compares it to the period 1970-1973 to demonstrate that this new focus represents a shift from basic biological and ecological issues. On average, approximately 46\% of papers published on whales, dolphins and porpoises in 2005-2008 were categorized as conservation oriented versus focused on biology or ecology. This contrasts to approximately 10\% in 1970-1973. This shift parallels other marine research subjects, such as benthic communities, coral reefs and sea turtles and reflects a general paradigm shift in marine research towards anthropogenic impacts. This is important guidance for institutions and organizations that wish to base their agendas and decisions on state-of-the-art scientific priorities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In the Italian academic context in particular, favoritism is recognized as a diffuse phenomenon affecting hiring and career advancement. One of the questions that naturally arises is whether women who do assume decisional roles, having witnessed other phenomena of discrimination, would practice less favoritism than men in similar positions. Our analysis refers to the particular case of favoritism in the work of university selection committees responsible for career advancement. We observe a moderate positive association between competitions with expected outcomes and the fact the committee president is a woman. Although committees presided by women give more weight to scientific merit than those presided by men, favoritism still occurs. In fact, in the case the committee president is a woman, the single most important factor for the success of a candidate is joint research with the president, while in the case of male presidents, it is the years together in the same university.},

Based on career and publication data of virtually all sociologists working in German sociology departments, we test how meritocratic factors (academic productivity) as well as non-meritocratic factors (ascription, symbolic and social capital) influence the chances of getting a permanent professorship in sociology. Our findings show that getting tenure in sociology is strongly related to scholarly output, as previous studies have shown. Improving on existing studies, however, we show specifically that each refereed journal article and each monograph increases a sociologist's chance for tenure by 10 to 15 percent, while other publications affect odds for tenure only marginally and in some cases even negatively. Regarding non-meritocratic factors, we show that network size, individual reputation, and gender matters. Women get their first permanent position as university professor with on average 23 to 44 percent fewer publications than men; all else being equal, they are about 1.4 times more likely to get tenure than men. The article generally contributes to a better understanding of the role of meritocratic and non-meritocratic factors in achieving scarce and highly competitive job positions in academia.

The Evaluation Methodology is purely quantitative and focused solely on research outputs (publications, patents, prototypes, etc.) to determine the amount of institutional funding for research organizations. While aiming to depersonalize and depoliticize the allocation of institutional funding in the research system, improve research productivity, and safeguard accountability, we argue that the Evaluation Methodology has in fact become a negative example of a performance-based research funding system. Our analysis of the Evaluation Methodology shows that it has introduced considerable instability and unpredictability in the Czech research system, making strategic planning for research organizations difficult. The article contributes to a growing body of literature on research evaluation and performance-based research funding systems, discussing the impacts of introducing such systems in countries including the UK, Spain, Slovakia, Hong Kong, Australia, Poland, Italy, New Zealand, Flanders, Norway, Denmark, and Finland.

Diffusion scores, together with science overlay maps, show that uptake of the HSD publications extends into the natural, as well as social, sciences.

Research metrics provide an objective way to assess the research output of individuals, groups, departments and universities.

Revolutionary research in mature sciences and unfashionable revolutionary research in early stage sciences remain mostly invisible to research metrics in the short term. This kind of research may become measurable in the long term if it turns out to be successful and generates a large volume of follow-on research that becomes part of normal science. Pursuing revolutionary research is risky, and this risk is modulated by the availability of an appropriate research workforce and the funding environment. Hype and spin are part of the mechanisms of scientific public opinion, and dealing with these is important in the context of management decisions based on research metrics.},

The relative performance of actual applicants (compared to potential applicants) is of interest to funding organizations when developing, rearranging and promoting their funding schemes. The question is: 'Does a funding scheme attract the "best" young scientists?' Or are there alternative attractive ways of pursuing a scientific career that influence the choice of potential applicants? In this article we examine that question by using bibliometric methods to compare a sample of applicants for the Emmy Noether Programme (ENP) provided by the German Research Foundation (DFG) with potential applicants (people who actually hold a professorship or are qualified for it (Habilitierte), and who are from the same cohort of postdocs as the ENP applicants, but did not apply for the ENP.},

Using a data set on 52 science research groups that have been evaluated in view of an on-going series of research assessments at the University of Antwerp (Belgium), we build cumulative logistic regression models that explain the assessments of research group quality and productivity. In addition to the discipline, the predictors in the models explaining quality and productivity are group size, h-index of the group leader, and efficiency in terms of publishing in top journals.

A main feature of the model is that publications are classified at two levels, where higher-level papers are valued more in terms of the model's publication points. Points are then awarded based on the fractional counts. When following the group of researchers that has been active over the entire period, 2004-12, we find that average points per researcher have fallen over the period. However, at the same time, average publication counts and number coauthors per paper have increased substantially. Essentially, productivity in publication counts has increased but productivity in fractional counts has fallen, as has average publication points. While both increased publications and collaboration would appear to be viewed as positive developments from a policy standpoint, the model's point system risks discouraging collaboration.},

We focus on what goes on between researchers and other actors, and so narrow the gap between research and impact, or at least make it transparent. And by making the process visible, we are able to suggest indicator categories that arguably lead to more robust measuring instruments.

Thus, it describes the functions of the 'author' discussed by Foucault that can assist to reveal the characteristics of the scientific practice and examples of how theories are materialized. As a result, it identifies the ways in which modern science is developed and how knowledge is construed by multiple authors, group authors, the merit that is attributed by citations, etc. This article highlights the complexity of authorship attribution and the need to rethink generalized bibliometric techniques to evaluate science considering other aspects that go beyond the mere listing of the authors.},

The vast majority of scientific disciplines use a contribution-based norm, according to which authors who contributed the most are listed first. Very few disciplines, most notably economics, instead resort primarily to the norm of listing authors in alphabetical order. It has been argued that (1) this alphabetical norm gives an unfair advantage to researchers with last name initials early in the alphabet and that (2) researchers are aware of this 'alphabetical discrimination' and react strategically to it, for example by avoiding collaborations with multiple authors. This article reviews the empirical literature and finds convincing evidence that alphabetical discrimination exists and that researchers react to it.},

Yet there remains a lack of investigation focusing on national PBRF settings which appear to be particularly conducive to isomorphism. Addressing the resulting lacuna, this article investigates the extent to which Australian universities replicate national PBRF indicators in their individual-level performance management frameworks for academic staff. Drawing on data from 33 Australian universities (of 39 eligible institutions), and taking into consideration the differences in these universities' level of research intensity, this article finds that universities overwhelmingly replicate the major national PBRF indicators internally. If variation was evident, then mostly in the form of minor modifications to these indicators, not in the choice of indicators per se. Analysis of the Australian case thus demonstrates strong vertical alignment between national and institutional research governance mechanisms as well as considerable convergence in the formal organization and governance of research activities at Australian universities.},

By building on the literature on research funding, the indicator combines information on how funding is allocated with quantitative measures of funding volumes. It is operationalized in terms of a fine-grained decomposition of public R\&D funding in instruments, each of them characterized by their mode and criteria of allocation. Building on a large-scale European project, we test the operationalization of the indicator for a sample of European countries, and we perform a set of sensitivity and robustness analyses to inquire the impact of definitions and of data issues, particularly for what concerns cross-country comparisons.

Methods to evaluate research impact on policy processes and outcomes are especially underdeveloped, and are needed to optimize the influence of research on policy for addressing complex issues such as chronic diseases. Contribution analysis (CA), a theory-based approach to evaluation, holds promise under these conditions of complexity. Yet applications of CA for this purpose are limited, and methods are needed to strengthen contribution claims and ensure CA is practical to implement. This article reports the experience of a public health research center in Canada that applied CA to evaluate the impacts of its research on policy changes. The main goal was to experiment with methods that were relevant to CA objectives, sufficiently rigorous for making credible claims, and feasible. Methods were 'good enough' if they achieved all three attributes. Three cases on government policy in tobacco control were examined: creation of smoke-free multiunit dwellings, creation of smoke-free outdoor spaces, and regulation of flavored tobacco products. Getting to 'good enough' required careful selection of nested theories of change; strategic use of social science theories, as well as quantitative and qualitative data from diverse sources; and complementary methods to assemble and analyze evidence for testing the nested theories of change. Some methods reinforced existing good practice standards for CA, and others were adaptations or extensions of them. Our experience may inform efforts to influence policy with research, evaluate research impacts on policy using CA, and apply CA more broadly.},

Moreover, conclusions are not entirely consistent among research areas, and 'early view' and 'selection bias' have been suggested as possible explications. In the present article, an analysis of gold OA from across all areas of research-the 27 subject areas of the Scopus database-is realized. As a novel contribution, this article takes a journal-level approach to assessing the OA citation advantage, whereas many others take a paper-level approach. Data were obtained from Scimago Lab, sorted using Scopus database, and tagged as OA/non-OA using the DOAJ list. Jointly with the OA citation advantage, the OA prevalence as well as the differences between access types (OA vs. non-OA) in production and referencing are tested. A total of 3,737 OA journals (16.8\%) and 18,485 non-OA journals (83.2\%) published in 2015 are considered.

Drawing on a case study of a large-scale project on (un)sustainable consumption, this paper demonstrates the range, complexity and potential long-term nature of impact in interdisciplinary sustainability research. It thus supports arguments for alternative approaches to impact assessment that question conventional views of translating scientific knowledge into action, value the multi-directionality of science-society relations and recognise diverse forms of engagement between scientists and non-scientific actors through non-academic channels and outputs. The paper also challenges common (mis)conceptions of work practices in a university context by demonstrating the highly innovative and inclusive nature of much sustainability research that seeks to address the needs of diverse communities of actors. It is argued that only radically different ways of conceptualising and measuring short-, medium- and long-term impacts can capture the success or otherwise of social-scientific and interdisciplinary sustainability research.},

Amidst some network similarities, women are less likely to connect otherwise unconnected inventors (brokerage) and have greater status-asymmetries between themselves and their co-inventors. In multivariate models that include past and future activity, I find that some network benefits are contingent on gender. Men receive greater returns from network positioning for brokerage ties, and when collaborating with men. Women benefit from collaborating with women, and are more likely to collaborate with women, but both men and women collaborate with mostly men.

Based on a unique database and responses from 870 entrepreneurship scholars, we demonstrate that entrepreneurship can be regarded as a phenomenon-driven field bound together by a shared communication system and social interaction rather than strong theoretical influences, i.e., a social scholarly community. We identify two broader social communities; one embedded in entrepreneurship conferences that includes a rather eclectic group of entrepreneurship scholars, and another related to entrepreneurship journals and entrepreneurship economics, characterized by a stronger domain orientation. In contrast, scholars in innovation studies tend to be more theory-driven and are bound together by their disciplinary and theoretical background, i.e., an intellectual scholarly community.},

The present qualitative study sets out to identify the mediating mechanisms connecting organizational capacities made possible through the CoE grant (e.g. recruitment/human capital, data/infrastructure and various collaborative arrangements), and epistemic effects such as extension into new problem areas and higher degrees of risk taking in research generally. We conclude that a CoE program theory can be conceived in terms of resource stability yielding research flexibility, and that the common mechanisms connecting the two may be found in organizational arrangements facilitating slack (autonomy), availability of cooperative partners (critical mass) and concomitant cooperation between specialisms. It is our belief that by explicating such mechanisms CoE program theory can be greatly improved.},

In this study, we investigate how bibliometrics are used for evaluating the impact and quality of publications in two specific settings: biomedicine and economics. Our study exposes the various metrics used in external evaluations of candidates for academic positions at Swedish universities. Moreover, we show how different bibliometric indicators, both explicitly and implicitly, are employed to assess and rank candidates. Our findings contribute to a further understanding of bibliometric indicators as 'judgment devices' that are employed in evaluating individuals and their published works within specific fields. We also show how 'expertise' in using bibliometrics for evaluative purposes is negotiated at the interface between domain knowledge and skills in using indicators. In line with these results, we propose that the use of metrics we report is best described as a form of 'citizen bibliometrics'- an underspecified term which we build upon in the article.},

	abstract = {In many countries research evaluations confer high importance to mainstream journals, which are considered to publish excellent research. Accordingly, research evaluation policies discourage publications in other non mainstream journals under the assumption that they publish low quality research. This approach has prompted a policy debate in low and middle-income countries, which face financial and linguistic barriers to access mainstream journals. A common criticism of the current evaluation practices is that they can hinder the development of certain topics that are not published in mainstream journals although some of them might be of high local relevance. In this article, we examine this issue by exploring the functions of non-mainstream journals in scientific communication. We interviewed researchers from agricultural sciences, business and management, and chemistry in Colombia on their reasons to publish in non-mainstream journals. We found that non-mainstream journals serve the following functions: 1) offer a space for initiation into publishing (training); 2) provide a link between articles in mainstream journals and articles read by communities with limited access to them (knowledge-bridging); 3) publish topics that are not well covered by mainstream journals (knowledge gap-filling). Therefore, publication in non-mainstream journals cannot be attributed only to 'low scientific quality' research. They also fulfil specific communication functions. These results suggest that research evaluation policy in low and middle-income countries should consider assigning greater value to non-mainstream journals given their role in bridging and disseminating potentially useful and novel knowledge.},

We find that eminent scientists are more harshly penalized than their less distinguished peers in the wake of a retraction, but only in cases involving fraud or misconduct.

We build on a bibliometric analysis of more than 85,000 papers published in 168 management and business journals as rated in 18 popular journal rankings. Results refute some often repeated but rarely substantiated criticisms of journal rankings. Contrary to many voices, we find that interdisciplinarity and innovativeness are positively associated with publication in highly ranked journals. In other respects, our results support more critical assumptions, such as a widespread preference for quantitative methods.

In doing so high-risk/high-return research is found to be more attractive and financially rational than under the traditional peer review approach. In other words projects with the highest disagreement amongst panel members should sometimes be selected even though the average panel score may not be the highest under consideration. This finding is important as it improves the existing peer review process by utilizing not only the mean value of peer reviews, but also their standard deviation.

The central argument of this paper is that the subject matter of many important fields of science is very different from that of physics - several of the physical sciences and much of biology, as well as the social sciences, are good examples - and that trying to ape the descriptive and analytic characteristics of physics in these fields hinders the development of understanding.

Mathematics has had a full range of impact types, particularly conceptual impacts, although more tangible instrumental impacts were prioritized for REF. Multiple mechanisms were utilized, but seldom appeared in REF case studies. Long-term relationship building and interdisciplinarity are particularly important. Departmental culture and certain knowledge intermediaries can play proactive roles.

Standardized case studies allow systematic codification of the variables for each case study, and the building of four ideal-type impact pathways. Each of these ideal-types is characterized by specific translation mechanisms, critical points, research and adoption networks, research outputs, and impacts.

The data are merged with information on individual researchers and characteristics of referees. The most important empirical finding is that there is a significant gender gap in research evaluation. The gap is reduced once we control for researchers' characteristics, such as age and academic rank, but is almost unaffected by the characteristics of the research output (monographs, journal articles, book chapters, etc.), co-authorships, international collaborations. Childbearing and maternity leaves do not account for the remaining gap in research evaluation. The evaluation method (peer review or bibliometric analysis) and the referee mix (whether men or women) do not disadvantage women. Analysis of a random sample of papers evaluated using bibliometric indicators and peer review reveals that bibliometric evaluation proves to be more favourable to women than peer review evaluation.

Creating a culture of reward requires consistency, alignment, and comprehensiveness at all stages and levels of evaluation, from defining expectations in the initial appointment to preparing individual candidates' dossiers to incorporating appropriate criteria. Several organizations have led the way in formulating recommendations for recognizing interdisciplinary and collaborative work. Professional societies and academic administrators at local levels are also providing leadership. Institution-wide policies are rare though do exist. More often individual units are issuing guidelines for appropriate evaluation. A number of studies have also called for widening definition of what counts for consideration, including innovative, applied, and commercial research and development. The overriding lesson to emerge is the importance of a systematic and informed approach. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Journal editors play a crucial role in the scientific publication system, as they make the final decision on acceptance or rejection of manuscripts. Some critics, however, suspect that the more innovative a manuscript is, the less likely it will be accepted for publication. Especially top-tier journals are accused of rejecting innovative research. As evidence is only anecdotal, this article empirically examines the demand side for innovative research manuscripts. I assess journal editors' innovativeness, i.e. their general predispositions for innovative research manuscripts. As antecedents to innovativeness, personal and contextual factors are taken into account. I differentiate the concept of innovativeness in research by distinguishing three dimensions: innovativeness in terms of research problems, theoretical approaches, and methodological approaches. Drawing on an international web-based survey, this study is based on responses of 866 journal editors. The article sheds light on editors' inclination toward accepting different forms of innovative research for publication. Overall, findings indicate that individual characteristics, such as editorial risk-taking or long-term orientation, are more decisive than journal-related characteristics regarding innovativeness. However, editors of older journals turn out to be less open toward new research problems and a u-shaped relationship between a journal's rating score and editor's willingness to adopt new theoretical approaches exists. Most surprisingly, editors' consensus orientation regarding reviewer recommendations is positively associated with methodological innovativeness.},

Theories and models that differ in their contextual independence, complexity of internal structures and specificity of causal processes contribute in different ways and under different conditions to the resolution of policy issues.

We also analyzed videotapes of reviewers' interactions for instances of one particular form of discourse-Score Calibration Talk-as one factor influencing the variability we observe.

A special focus is given to the Global South, as countries in this group have been converging with the Global North recently. We find that previous citation impact, level of international collaboration and total publications in a specific scientific field are important determinants of citation impact among all nations. However, specialization in particular scientific fields seems significantly more important in the Global South than in the Global North. These findings imply that most lower- and middle-income countries would better concentrate their resources in generating higher critical masses in specific fields, in addition to pursuing long-lasting international collaboration partnerships, as these actions may lead to higher impact research.

Using a unique data set compiled from the career histories of 10,051 elite life scientists in the U.S., we paint a nuanced picture of mobility. Prolific scientists are more likely to move, but this impulse is constrained by recent NIH funding. The quality of peer environments both near and far is an additional factor that influences mobility decisions. We also identify a significant role for family structure. Scientists appear to be unwilling to move when their children are between the ages of 14-17, and this appears to be more pronounced for mothers than fathers. These results suggest that elite scientists find it costly to disrupt the social networks of their children during adolescence and take these costs into account when making career decisions.

In this article we bring together three qualitative research projects undertaken in the Netherlands and Austria to contribute to filling this gap. The projects explored the role of performance metrics in the life sciences, and the interactions between institutional and disciplinary cultures of evaluating research in these fields. Our analytic perspective is focused on understanding how researchers themselves give value to research, and in how far these practices are related to performance metrics. The article zooms in on three key moments in research processes to show how 'thinking with indicators' is becoming a central aspect of research activities themselves: (1) the planning and conception of research projects, (2) the social organization of research processes, and (3) determining the endpoints of research processes. Our findings demonstrate how the worth of research activities becomes increasingly assessed and defined by their potential to yield high value in quantitative terms. The analysis makes visible how certain norms and values related to performance metrics are stabilized as they become integrated into routine practices of knowledge production. Other norms and criteria for scientific quality, e.g. epistemic originality, long-term scientific progress, societal relevance, and social responsibility, receive less attention or become redefined through their relations to quantitative indicators. We understand this trend to be in tension with policy goals that seek to encourage innovative, societally relevant, and responsible research.},

Previous studies have documented that aggregated federal R \& D funding has become more dispersed over time and attributed this to political pressure to spread resources more evenly. There have, however, been few studies of the allocation of funds within narrowly defined scientific disciplines. By narrowing the focus and exploiting the panel nature of our data we are better able to analyze the correlates of funding variation, yielding a number of new insights not apparent in studies using more aggregated data. First, we find that R \& D expenditures at the discipline level are considerably more volatile than aggregate funding. Second, we show a strong positive association between several measures of institutional research capacity and future funding. In particular, we find a positive association between the employment of postdoctoral researchers and higher future research funding.},

Such explorative research is often described as taking a novel approach. This study examines the complex relationship between pursuing a novel approach and impact. Viewing scientific research as a combinatorial process, we measure novelty in science by examining whether a published paper makes first-time-ever combinations of referenced journals, taking into account the difficulty of making such combinations. We apply this newly developed measure of novelty to all Web of Science research articles published in 2001 across all scientific disciplines. We find that highly novel papers, defined to be those that make more (distant) new combinations, deliver high gains to science: they are more likely to be a top 1\% highly cited paper in the long run, to inspire follow-on highly cited research, and to be cited in a broader set of disciplines and in disciplines that are more distant from their "home" field. At the same time, novel research is also more risky, reflected by a higher variance in its citation performance. We also find strong evidence of delayed recognition of novel papers as novel papers are less likely to be top cited when using short time-windows. In addition, we find that novel research is significantly more highly cited in "foreign" fields but not in their "home" field. Finally, novel papers are published in journals with a lower Impact Factor, compared with non-novel papers, ceteris paribus. These findings suggest that science policy, in particular funding decisions which rely on bibliometric indicators based on short-term citation counts and Journal Impact Factors, may be biased against "high risk/high gain" novel research. The findings also caution against a mono-disciplinary approach in peer review to assess the true value of novel research.},

Using a very complete database of funding, scientific papers and citations compiled at the individual researchers' level, we estimate panel data regressions on the discipline-normalised citation rates of individual academics in Quebec. Our results show that although most of the indicators examined have a positive influence on the relative citation rate, when it comes to gender differences, not having enough public funding and raising private funding appear slightly detrimental for women in the health sciences. In addition, when women collaborate with the same number of co-authors as men, or target similar Impact Factor journals, their articles are less cited then those of their male colleagues. Almost no gender effect is found in the natural sciences and engineering where women are still a minority. Our results worryingly show that academics who publish with a larger proportion of female co-authors are less cited. Furthermore, when targeting similar Impact Factor journals, researchers who collaborate with a higher proportion of female co-authors are consistently less cited in both the health and NSE fields than if they were publishing with a male dominated group of co-authors.

Although connections have been shown to bias predictions of uncertain future performance, it is unknown whether such biases occur in the more concrete task of assessing scientific validity for completed works, and if so, how. This study presents evidence that connections between authors and reviewers of neuroscience manuscripts are associated with biased judgments and explores the mechanisms driving that effect. Using reviews from 7981 neuroscience manuscripts submitted to the journal PLOS ONE, which instructs reviewers to evaluate manuscripts on scientific validity alone, we find that reviewers favored authors close in the co-authorship network by similar to 0.11 points on a 1.0-4.0 scale for each step of proximity. PLOS ONE's validity focused review and the substantial favoritism shown by distant vs. very distant reviewers, both of whom should have little to gain from nepotism, point to the central role of substantive disagreements between scientists in different professional networks ("schools of thought"). These results suggest that removing bias from peer review cannot be accomplished simply by recusing closely connected reviewers, and highlight the value of recruiting reviewers embedded in diverse professional networks.},

	abstract = {The assessment of research based on the journal in which it is published is a widely adopted practice. Some research assessments use the Web of Science (WoS) to identify 'high quality' journals, which are assumed to publish excellent research. The authority of WoS on journal quality stems from its selection of journals based on editorial standards and scientific impact criteria. These can be considered as universalistic criteria, meaning that they can be applied to any journal regardless of its place of publication, language, or discipline. In this article we examine the coverage by WoS of journals produced in Latin America, Spain, and Portugal. We use a logistic regression to examine the probability of a journal to be covered by WoS given universalistic criteria (editorial standards and scientific impact of the journal) and particularistic criteria (country, language, and discipline of the journal). We find that it is not possible to predict the inclusion of journals in WoS only through the universalistic criteria because particularistic variables such as country of the journal, its discipline, and language are strongly related to inclusion in WoS. We conclude that using WoS as a universalistic tool for research assessment can disadvantage science published in journals with adequate editorial standards and scientific merit. We discuss the implications of these findings within the research evaluation literature, specifically for countries and disciplines not extensively covered by WoS.},

We show that a certain fraction of low-quality science characterizes all the equilibria in the basic model. In fact, the absence of detected low-quality research can be interpreted as the lack of verification activities and thus as a potential limitation to the reliability of a field. Incentivizing incremental research and verification activities improves the expected quality of research; this effect, however, is contrasted by the incentives to free ride on performing verification if many scientists are involved, and may discourage scientists to undertake new research in the first place. Finally, softening incentives to publish does not enhance quality, although it increases the fraction of detected low-quality papers.

Using a unique dataset that connects individuals' National Institutes of Health funding histories to their publication records, we found that a large portion of the overall gender gap in the life sciences emerges at this transition. Women become PIs at a 20\% lower rate than men. Differences in "productivity" (publication records) can explain about 60\% of this differential. The remaining portion appears to stem from gender differences in the returns to similar publication records, with women receiving less credit for their citations.},

To do this, 11,127 articles and reviews from 2012 to 2014 were extracted from the Thomson Reuters Web of Science database. This accounted for 14,944 unique authors. To study the visibility of neurosurgery scholars in terms of social media metrics, the following altmetric indicators were used: Mendeley readers, the post count of news, tweets, blogs, LinkedIn, and Facebook. The methodology and procedures employed included descriptive statistics, chi-square test, two-sample proportion test, and analysis of covariance. The results demonstrated that the number of female scholars was significantly lower compared to their male counterparts. Additionally, female neurosurgery scientists were found to be slightly less prolific in terms of scientific productivity. However, women were slightly more visible with regard to citations, readership, and tweets. Finally, both genders were similarly successful in terms of receivingmentions from blogs, news, Facebook, or LinkedIn.},

Like in many other global and multidisciplinary societal problems fraught with high levels of uncertainty, a variety of perspectives have emerged over how to "tackle" avian influenza and public voices have expressed concern over how research funds are being allocated. In this article, we document if and how research agendas are being informed by public policy debates. We use qualitative and quantitative approaches to examine the relations between expectations of outcomes of public science and the existing research landscape. Interviews with a cross-section of stake-holders reveal a wide range of perspectives and values associated with the nature and objectives of existing research avenues. We find that the landscape of public avian influenza research is not directly driven by expectations of societal outcomes. Instead, it is shaped by three institutional drivers: pharmaceutical industry priorities, publishing and public research funding pressures, and the mandates of science-based policy or public health organizations. These insights suggest that, in research prioritization, funding agencies should embrace a broad perspective of research governance that explicitly considers underlying institutional drivers. Deliberative approaches in public priority setting might help to make agendas more plural and diverse and thus more responsive to the contested and uncertain nature of avian influenza research.},

We find that experienced firms establish external collaborations on the basis of cognitive social capital, but this basis is reinforced by relational social capital over time. Conversely, less experienced firms initially base their university collaborations on relational social capital, which is reinforced by cognitive social capital over time. Based on these findings, we theorize on the interplay of different dimensions of social capital in university-industry collaborations over time.

Institutions and governments often perceive hiring faculty who were trained in different countries as a strategy for reaching the status of world-class universities. The major assumption behind this hiring strategy is that faculty who are educated in prestigious universities in foreign countries will bring cutting edge knowledge and networks that will lead to future research collaborations. Yet, a dearth of research empirically investigated the assumption that institutions that train future foreign faculty and those that hire faculty with foreign degrees will have greater presence in the international networks of research collaboration. Filling this hole, this study examines this assumption from an international perspective, using the case of industrial engineering departments at selective research universities in Chile and Korea. Based on the unique data that document faculty hiring (degree attainment institutions) and research collaboration (co-authorship), and institutional prestige (global ranking positions), we analyzed the relationship between faculty hiring network and research collaboration network, as well as their association with institutional prestige. The results provide strong evidence of the positive relationships between doctoral training and future research collaboration, and the strong presence of institutions with global prestige. These relationships result in homophilic networks that suggest a concern about a reduced diversity in theoretical perspective and research methods within the disciplinary field.},

It is claimed that although many researchers do not consider indexing to be a theoretical issue (or consider it to be a field without theories) indexing is indeed highly theory-laden (and the idea of atheoretical indexing is an oxymoron). An important issue is also the subjectivity of the indexer, in particular, her socio-cultural and paradigmatic background, as for example, when authors of documents are the best indexers of their own documents.

It adopts a myriad of techniques to analyze and build efficient knowledge organization systems, and one of these techniques is called sentiment analysis (SA) or opinion mining, which is emerging as promising and useful in a variety of ways. It is based in NLP and AI algorithms, and aims at identifying opinions and emotions toward any person, organization or subject; evaluating them as positive or negative, in both binary and graded fashions. This study sought to show various aspects of the implementation of SA for knowledge organization tasks as registered in the scientific literature. We began with exploratory bibliographic research and built a corpus of 91 scientific papers, written in English, selected in the LISA Database, between 2000 to 2016. We analyzed these papers and extracted title, year of publication, author(s) and institution(s), title of the journal where they were published, keywords, the LISA classification code, methods/techniques adopted and its application areas. Our main findings are that theoretical papers still prevail, which may indicate a field in the early stages. We found many institutions and authors from Asia, which points to a new shift in world expertise. We concluded that SA is still a novelty in the KO field, being slowly adopted as an aid to the main tasks, as document classification.},

In order to determine its role in the field of knowledge organization, some common misconceptions and major criticisms will be reconsidered in light of a broader multidisciplinary context. In particular, it will be shown how this organizing principle has been fruitfully applied to human-related research areas such as psychology, social sciences, or humanities in terms of integrative levels of knowing.},

First, a similar methodology to that developed by Gross et al.

The results indicated that AEI users would also lose, on average, about a quarter of hits per query. Second, an alternative research design was applied in which an experienced literature searcher was asked to find resources on a set of educational topics on an AEI database stripped of its subject indexing and then asked to search for additional resources on the same topics after the subject indexing had been reinserted. In this study, the proportion of additional resources that would have been lost had it not been for the subject indexing was again found to be about a quarter of the total resources found for each topic, on average.},

Birger Hjorland was the most cited author, and was situated at or near the middle of each of the maps based on different citation relationships. The proximities between authors resulting from the different citation relationships demonstrate how authors situate themselves intellectually through the citations they give and how other authors situate them through the citations received. There is a consistent core of theoretical references as well among the most productive authors. We observed a close network of scholarly communication between the authors cited in this core, which indicates the actual role of the journal Knowledge Organization as a space for knowledge construction in the area of knowledge organization.},

From Antiquity to the Classical Age, it has a long history where philosophers (Aristotle), and natural scientists (Linnaeus), took a great part. But from the nineteenth century (with the growth of chemistry and information science) and the twentieth century (with the arrival of mathematical models and computer science), mathematics (especially theory of orders and theory of graphs or hypergraphs) allows us to compute all the possible partitions, chains of partitions, covers, hypergraphs or systems of classes we can construct on a domain. In spite of these advances, most of classifications are still based on the evaluation of ressemblances between objects that constitute the empirical data. However, all these classifications remain, for technical and epistemological reasons we detail below, very unstable ones. We lack a real algebra of classifications, which could explain their properties and the relations existing between them. Though the aim of a general theory of classifications is surely a wishful thought, some recent conjecture gives the hope that the existence of a metaclassification (or classification of all classification schemes) is possible.},

The classification structure created by division has some admirable properties; any item to be classified has its own unique place in a leaf class and inherits attributes from the unique branch going from that leaf to the root. The structure embodies the maximum amount of general attribute information about the items being classified. Such classification structures have proved viable and useful both for classification of non-animate natural kinds and for classification of artificial kinds. Classification structures created by logical division seem unsuitable for living organisms. This is largely because classification of living organisms seems to require attention to ancestry and common ancestry and not just to shared characteristics. Logical division sheds no light on ancestry.},

Our study presents three domain analytical case analyses in search of answers. The first case relies on citations located using the ISKO-supported "Knowledge Organization Bibliography." The second case relies on works in both Web of Science and SCOPUS. Case three applies co-word analysis and citation analysis to the contents of the papers in the present special issue. We observe scholars involved in "clustering" and "automatic classification" who share common thematic emphases. But we have found no coherence, no common activity and no social semantics. We have not found a research front, or a common teleology within the KO domain. We also have found a lively group of authors who have succeeded in submitting papers to this special issue, and their work quite interestingly aligns with the case studies we report. There is an emphasis on KO for information retrieval; there is much work on clustering (which involves conceptual points within texts) and automatic classification (which involves semantic groupings at the meta-document level).},

There is strong support for the view that a natural classification should be based on a theory (and, of course, that the most fruitful theory provides the most fruitful classification). Nevertheless, atheoretical (or "descriptive") classifications are often produced. Paradoxically, atheoretical classifications may be very successful. The best example of a successful "atheoretical" classification is probably the prestigious Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) since its third edition from 1980. Based on such successes one may ask: Should the claim that classifications ideally are natural and theory-based be reconsidered? This paper argues that the seemingly success of atheoretical classifications hides deeper problems and that the ideal of theory-based classification should be maintained.},

The document-oriented view conceives subject as something inherent in documents, whereas the request-oriented view (or the policy-based view) understands subject as an attribution made to documents in order to facilitate certain uses of them. Related concepts such as concepts, aboutness, topic, isness and ofness are also briefly presented.

There exist different historical and theoretical approaches to and theories about KO, which are related to different views of knowledge, cognition, language, and social organization. Each of these approaches tends to answer the question: "What is knowledge organization?" differently. LIS professionals have often concentrated on applying new technology and standards, and may not have seen their work as involving interpretation and analysis of meaning. That is why library classification has been criticized for a lack of substantive intellectual content. Traditional human-based activities are increasingly challenged by computer-based retrieval techniques. It is appropriate to investigate the relative contributions of different approaches; the current challenges make it imperative to reconsider this understanding.

This article introduces different conceptions of "theory" and argues that a theory is a statement or a conception, which is considered open to be questioned and which is connected with background assumptions. Theories form interconnected systems of grand, middle rank and micro theories and actions, practices and artifacts are theory-laden. The concept of knowledge organization system (KOS) is briefly introduced and discussed. A theory is a form of KOS and theories are the point of departure of any KOS. It is generally understood in KO that concepts are the units of KOSs, but the theory-dependence of concepts brings theories to the forefront in analyzing concepts and KOSs. The study of theories should therefore be given a high priority within KO concerning the construction and evaluation of KOSs.},

Published literature in biomedical sciences is a huge source of knowledge, which can only efficiently be managed through automatic methods. The conventional channel for reporting scientific results is Web electronic publishing. Despite its advances, scientific articles are still published in print formats such as portable document format (PDF). Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies provides new opportunities for communicating, sharing, and integrating scientific knowledge that can overcome the limitations of the current print format. Here is proposed a semantic model of scholarly electronic articles in biomedical sciences that can overcome the limitations of traditional flat records formats. Scientific knowledge consists of claims made throughout article texts, especially when semantic elements such as questions, hypotheses and conclusions are stated. These elements, although having different roles, express relationships between phenomena. Once such knowledge units are extracted and represented with technologies such as RDF (Resource Description Framework) and linked data, they may be integrated in reasoning chains. Thereby, the results of scientific research can be published and shared in structured formats, enabling crawling by software agents, semantic retrieval, knowledge reuse, validation of scientific results, and identification of traces of scientific discoveries.},

The Places \& Spaces Map of Science (Klavans and Boyack 2007) was used to determine the proximity of disciplines to one another in order to select the two disciplines use in the analysis. Groups analyzed share common theories and goals; however, groups used different language to describe their research. It was found that 61\% of term words were shared between the two groups.},

The purpose of this work is to add another instance on the research linking information retrieval and bibliometric techniques aided by information technology. A domain analytic method was developed to generate clusters of documents, which uses self-organizing maps, in the scope of artificial neural networks, to categorize documents. The results obtained show that this approach successfully identified clusters of authors and documents through their cited references. In addition, further qualitative analysis of these clusters demonstrates the existence of semantic relationships between the documents. This study can contribute to the development of the field of knowledge organization by evaluating the use of artificial neural networks in the automatic categorization of documents in a constricted knowledge domain based on the analysis of the references cited by these documents.},

Though widely used, peer review is not without flaws and critics. Performing large-scale experiments to evaluate and test correctives and alternatives is difficult, if not impossible. Thus, many researchers have turned to simulation studies to overcome these difficulties. In the last 10 years this field of research has grown significantly but with only limited attempts to integrate disparate models or build on previous work. Thus, the resulting body of literature consists of a large variety of models, hinging on incompatible assumptions, which have not been compared, and whose predictions have rarely been empirically tested. This scoping review is an attempt to understand the current state of simulation studies of peer review. Based on 46 articles identified through literature searching, we develop a proposed taxonomy of model features that include model type (e.g. formal models vs. ABMs or other) and the type of modeled peer review system (e.g. peer review in grants vs. in journals or other). We classify the models by their features (including some core assumptions) to help distinguish between the modeling approaches. Finally, we summarize the models' findings around six general themes: decision-making, matching submissions/reviewers, editorial strategies; reviewer behaviors, comparisons of alternative peer review systems, and the identification and addressing of biases. We conclude with some open challenges and promising avenues for future modeling work.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          The reproducibility crisis in science is a multifaceted problem involving practices and incentives, both in the laboratory and in publication. Fortunately, some of the root causes are known and can be addressed by scientists and authors alike. After careful consideration of the available literature, the National Institutes of Health identified several key problems with the way that scientists conduct and report their research and introduced guidelines to improve the rigor and reproducibility of pre-clinical studies. Many journals have implemented policies addressing these same criteria. We currently have, however, no comprehensive data on how these guidelines are impacting the reporting of research. Using SciScore, an automated tool developed to review the methods sections of manuscripts for the presence of criteria associated with the NIH and other reporting guidelines, e.g., ARRIVE, RRIDs, we have analyzed ∼1.6 million PubMed Central papers to determine the degree to which articles were addressing these criteria. The tool scores each paper on a ten point scale identifying sentences that are associated with compliance with criteria associated with increased rigor (5 pts) and those associated with key resource identification and authentication (5 pts). From these data, we have built the Rigor and Transparency Index, which is the average score for analyzed papers in a particular journal. Our analyses show that the average score over all journals has increased since 1997, but remains below five, indicating that less than half of the rigor and reproducibility criteria are routinely addressed by authors. To analyze the data further, we examined the prevalence of individual criteria across the literature, e.g., the reporting of a subject’s sex (21-37\% of studies between 1997 and 2019), the inclusion of sample size calculations (2-10\%), whether the study addressed blinding (3-9\%), or the identifiability of key biological resources such as antibodies (11-43\%), transgenic organisms (14-22\%), and cell lines (33-39\%). The greatest increase in prevalence for rigor criteria was seen in the use of randomization of subjects (10-30\%), while software tool identifiability improved the most among key resource types (42-87\%). We further analyzed individual journals over time that had implemented specific author guidelines covering rigor criteria, and found that in some journals, they had a big impact, whereas in others they did not. We speculate that unless they are enforced, author guidelines alone do little to improve the number of criteria addressed by authors. Our Rigor and Transparency Index did not correlate with the impact factors of journals.},

Internationally, highereducation systems differ substantially withregard to research and education fundingsources and to ways that resources areallocated. European universities receive themajority of their funding from public sources,but private funding plays a more important rolein Anglo-American systems of higher education.Many governments use competitive elements inthe process of allocating public funds toinstitutions of higher education. Examplesinclude the implementation of performancemeasures through “formula funding”, or resourceallocation on the basis of evaluated projectproposals. Corresponding forms ofperformance-based resource allocation can befound within most higher educationinstitutions. This article analyzes how variousforms of funding and resource allocation affectuniversities at the macro-level and individualbehavior at the micro-level. A theoreticalapproach to this problem suggests thatperformance-based funding tends to bring aboutpositive changes but is also a factor inunintended side effects. Forms of resourceallocation influence the behavior of academicsand managers in higher education, particularlytheir levels of activity as well as the kindsof activities they engage in and their ways ofdealing with risks. Empirical analyses partlyconfirm these hypotheses. It can be shown thatchanges in resource allocation have an impacton the level and type of activity academicsconcentrate on but not on the long-term successof universities.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to look at public research funding systems from the perspective of their broader institutional arrangements, in order to observe how these shape the relationships between funding agencies and research actors. Accordingly, public funding is considered as a multilevel and multiactor system, where stable patterns are largely generated by the collective interaction among actors (beyond formal rules and structures) and where coordination between actors (especially funding agencies and performers) represents a key for the functionality of the systems. This drives to characterise the main organisational forms of public research funding in terms of their underlying coordination mode and to use this framework to evaluate them against a number of criteria. Further, the way how these organisational forms can be combined to yield national-level configurations is discussed, and some of their properties and conditions of functioning are derived from the previous discussion; this also leads to identification of three main configurations of funding systems – the project-based model, the mixed model, the vertically integrated model – which describe the variety of national systems and, to a large extent, underpin current discussion on European research policy.},

This paper aims to (a) compare the funding patterns of two biomedical domains that differ in their basic versus clinical nature, and (b) to elucidate the factors that influence the presence of funding. To do so, we draw on the scientific output of Spain-based researchers in the Virology (basic) and Cardiac and Cardiovascular Systems (clinical) domains as covered by the Web of Science database. Funding rate, public versus private funding source, and national versus foreign origin of the funds are examined through an analysis of funding acknowledgements in published papers. The relationship between funding and different bibliometric indicators such as impact, collaboration, basic or clinical research level, and authors’ institutional sector is scrutinised. Funded studies tend to have higher impact and are more likely to have foreign partners, findings which are aligned with the objectives pursued by public funding agencies. Clinical research and research done in hospital settings are less likely to be funded. The likelihood of funding increases with the number of institutions in the clinical domain but not in the basic one. Although collaboration is fostered by public research agencies and funding may enhance the establishment of collaborative links among researchers, the likelihood of being funded does not always increase with the number of institutions, because other factors such as the type of institution and the clinical or basic nature of the research have a significant moderating effect.},

	abstract = {There is increasing interest in assessing how sponsored research funding influences the development and trajectory of science and technology. Traditionally, linkages between research funding and subsequent results are hard to track, often requiring access to separate funding or performance reports released by researchers or sponsors. Tracing research sponsorship and output linkages is even more challenging when researchers receive multiple funding awards and collaborate with a variety of differentially-sponsored research colleagues. This article presents a novel bibliometric approach to undertaking funding acknowledgement analysis which links research outputs with their funding sources. Using this approach in the context of nanotechnology research, the article probes the funding patterns of leading countries and agencies including patterns of cross-border research sponsorship. We identify more than 91,500 nanotechnology articles published worldwide during a 12-month period in 2008-2009. About 67\% of these publications include funding acknowledgements information. We compare articles reporting funding with those that do not (for reasons that may include reliance on internal core-funding rather than external awards as well as omissions in reporting). While we find some country and field differences, we judge that the level of reporting of funding sources is sufficiently high to provide a basis for analysis. The funding acknowledgement data is used to compare nanotechnology funding policies and programs in selected countries and to examine their impacts on scientific output. We also examine the internationalization of research funding through the interplay of various funding sources at national and organizational levels. We find that while most nanotechnology funding is nationally-oriented, internationalization and knowledge exchange does occur as researchers collaborate across borders. Our method offers a new approach not only in identifying the funding sources of publications but also in feasibly undertaking large-scale analyses across scientific fields, institutions and countries.},

The growth of result quantity in the CZ has been faster than in seven other European countries selected for comparison. Because the accelerated growth has started already before 2008, implementation of the performance-based funding could not have been its cause. Likely cause of the growth could be either the evaluation of R\&D institutions introduced in 2004 itself and/or growth of public R\&D funding in the past decade.

This research analyzes funding acknowledgment presence in scientific publications and introduces a novel approach for discovering text patterns by discipline in the acknowledgment section of papers.

Funding acknowledgments are present in two thirds of Spanish articles, with significant differences by subject area, number of authors, impact factor of journals, and, in one specific area, basic/applied nature of research. Second, the existence of specific acknowledgment patterns in English-language papers of Spanish researchers in 4 selected subject categories (cardiac and cardiovascular systems, economics, evolutionary biology, and statistics and probability) is explored through a combination of text mining and multivariate analyses. Peer interactive communication predominates in the more theoretical or social-oriented fields (statistics and probability, economics), whereas the recognition of technical assistance is more common in experimental research (evolutionary biology), and the mention of potential conflicts of interest emerges forcefully in the clinical field (cardiac and cardiovascular systems). The systematic inclusion of structured data about acknowledgments in journal articles and bibliographic databases would have a positive impact on the study of collaboration practices in science.},

It may, however, be difficult to find evidence of the intervention impact of research grants for ex post evaluations of grant schemes. Based on data on applicants to Danish and Norwegian open mode grant schemes-research projects as well as post doc fellowships-this article applies difference in difference analysis to study to what extent research grants are likely to affect the publication and citation rates of the principle investigators (PIs). The results show higher increases in the number of publications for grant recipients than for rejected applicants, while increases in mean normalized citation rates were not significantly higher for the successful applicants. In other words, the grants seem to have increased productivity, e.g. by helping PIs to add staff to their research teams, but not to have influenced the importance of the research as measured by average citations. However, along with increases in the number of publications also came a greater increase in the number of highly cited papers for grant recipients than for rejected applicants. In sum, the analyses indicate that the measurement of grant impact is sensitive to how research performance is defined and tested using bibliometric indicators. Furthermore, the applicants' complex landscape of multiple projects and grants makes it difficult to isolate the output of a single grant. Hence, using bibliometrics to measure the impact of smaller grant schemes and smaller grants may often yield inconclusive results.},

For this purpose, a comparison is made between network data in the period before support started (2003-2005) and in the period after support started (2009-2011). For these two periods, a co-authorship network is generated (based on the funded institutions). This is based on publications which are among the 1 \% most frequently cited publications in their respective fields and publication year and which have at least one author from Germany. As the results show, the outcomes this yields for life sciences and natural sciences differ from each other. Whereas natural sciences display an effect of establishment of Clusters of Excellence on the bibliometric networks, this was not true of life sciences. After establishment of the Clusters of Excellence, the network in natural sciences not only contained more institutions of a Cluster of Excellence, but these institutions were distributed across fewer bibliometric clusters in the network than before establishment. In other words the structure of the Clusters of Excellence was better reflected in the network.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel model of science funding that exploits the wisdom of the scientific crowd. Each researcher receives an equal, unconditional part of all available science funding on a yearly basis, but is required to individually donate to other scientists a given fraction of all they receive. Science funding thus moves from one scientist to the next in such a way that scientists who receive many donations must also redistribute the most. As the funding circulates through the scientific community it is mathematically expected to converge on a funding distribution favored by the entire scientific community. This is achieved without any proposal submissions or reviews. The model furthermore funds scientists instead of projects, reducing much of the overhead and bias of the present grant peer review system. Model validation using large-scale citation data and funding records over the past 20 years show that the proposed model could yield funding distributions that are similar to those of the NSF and NIH, and the model could potentially be more fair and more equitable. We discuss possible extensions of this approach as well as science policy implications.},

The Polish system uses mostly parametric assessments to make the evaluation more objective and independent from its peers. We have analysed data on one million research outcomes and assessment results of 962 scientific units in the period 2009-2012. Our study aims to determine how much data the research funding system needs to proceed with evaluation. We have used correlation analysis, multivariate logistic regressions models and decision trees to show which metrics of the evaluation played a major role in the final results. Our analysis revealed that many metrics taken into account in the evaluation are closely correlated. We have found that in the Polish system, not all the collected data are necessary to achieve the main goal of the system, namely the categorization of scientific units in terms of their research performance. Our findings highlight the fact that there is a high correlation between performance in terms of publications and the scientific potential of a given scientific unit. We conclude with recommendations and a suggestion of a transition from a system in which the scientific units report all their metrics to a system in which they show only the most important metrics that meet the requirements of excellence in research.

First, we examined data for Japanese principal investigators receiving research funding between 2000 and 2010 in the field of nanotechnology and materials science, and identified groups of researchers whose publication performance was positively affected by the mission-oriented grant, CREST. We then compared the effect of CREST with that of the curiosity-driven grant, KAKENHI. The analysis uses both propensity score matching and difference in differences (PSM-DID) methodologies. Our results show that for participants in the CREST program there was an increase in number of publications of more than 10\% per year, for periods of both 5 and 3 years after the funding ended, even though the observed average effect on citation was not statistically significant. Second, we evaluated the diversity of research subjects through analysis of the distribution of the classification codes applied to articles published between 1996 and 2013, utilizing the J-Global database, which has the finest granularity of category among existing bibliographic scientific publication databases. Research subjects were better conserved under the mission-oriented program than the curiosity-driven one, a finding contrary to predictions of conventional theory. We also found that under mission-oriented funding, there was an increase in diversity in the sense of marginal utility. These findings should be of use in the "diversityaware" design of programs for the funding of fundamental research.},

While the presence of funding acknowledgements may serve as an indicator of quality to some extent, we still lack tools to evaluate whether funding agencies allocate resources to novel and innovative research rather than mature fields. We address this issue in the present study by using bibliometrics. In particular, we exploit the citation network properties of academic articles to classify specific research fields into four categories: change maker, breakthrough, incremental, and matured. We then use funding acknowledgement information to identify the sponsors involved in each research type to characterize funding agencies. We focus our analysis on the robotics field in order to reveal international trends of financial acknowledgements. We find that the incremental and matured research areas show the highest counts of funding acknowledgements. Moreover, although research funded by some agencies is mostly recognized as incremental-type research, those in other categoriesmay perform better in terms of the number of citations. Additionally, we analyze the interest of selected funding agencies in granular subject categories. The characterization of funding agencies in this study may help policymakers and funding organizations assess or adjust their strategies, benchmark with other key players, and obtain an overview of local and global acknowledgement trends.},

The corpus is composed of 268,779 papers, of which 71.4\% include information on funding acknowledgments. The greater presence of FA in Q1 journals, when compared to the totality of journals (all quartiles) and minimally cited articles, when compared to the totality of articles without FA, can be considered a quality indicator of the Brazilian funded research. In general, the presence of FA in theoretical and social areas such as Social Sciences and Humanities is significantly low when compared to disciplines in experimental and applied sciences such as Physics and Chemistry and indicates a lower reliance on funding in the former. The results reveal a greater presence of FA in papers of multiple authorship, probably as a result of the complexity and financial cost of teamwork investigations. It concludes that the presence of funding acknowledgments in Brazilian papers varies according to the area due to their particularities, such as nature and orientation of the research, publication profile, organizational structure, among others.},

Design/methodology/approach: The study takes the form of a policy analysis mainly drawing on document analysis of policy papers, previously published studies and grey literature. Findings: The study highlights a number of crucial factors that relate both to the Danish process and to the final Danish result underscoring that the Danish BFI model is indeed a quite different system than its Norwegian counterpart. One consequence of these process- and design differences is the fact that the broader legitimacy of the Danish BFI today appears to be quite poor. Reasons for this include: unclear and shifting objectives throughout the process; limited willingness to take ownership of the model among stakeholders; lack of communication throughout the implementation process and an apparent underestimation of the challenges associated with the use of bibliometric indicators. Research limitation: The conclusions of the study are based on the authors' interpretation of a long drawn and complex process with many different stakeholders involved. The format of this article does not allow for a detailed documentation of all elements, but further details can be provided upon request. Practical implications: The analysis may feed into current policy discussions on the future of the Danish BFI.

Using a regression model with Heckman bias correction, we find that funding has a positive, significant association with a paper's citations in STEMM fields. Further analyses show that this association is magnified by the factors of multiple authorship and multiple institutions. For funded papers in STEM, multi-author and multi-institution papers tend to receive even more citations than single-authored and single-institution papers; however, funded papers in Medicine received less gain in citation impact when either factor is considered. Based on the finding that funding support has a stronger association with citation impact when it is treated as a binary variable than as a count variable, this paper recommends the allocation of funding to researchers without active funding support, instead of giving awards to those with multiple funding supports at hand.},

At first, with the academic publication output extracted from the concluding report project manager submitted to the government after the fund finished, we designed the analysis framework to search and define the research field the fund belonged to. And then from the following three perspectives, including quantity, quality and relative influence, we compared the research fund output to the field output. Later, we took one fund program from national program on key basic research project of China (973 Program) in the field of quantum physics as an example to make an empirical analysis to demonstrate its effectiveness.

It examines in detail the variable rate of knowledge production in the field, shifts in subject coverage, the dominance of particular publication genres at different times, prevailing modes of production, interactions with other disciplines, and, more generally, observes how the field has evolved. It shows that, despite a striking growth in the number of journals, papers, and contributing authors, a decrease was observed in the field's market-share of all social science and humanities research. Collaborative authorship is now the norm, a pattern seen across the social sciences. The idea of boundary crossing was also examined: in 2010, nearly 60\% of authors who published in LIS also published in another discipline. This high degree of permeability in LIS was also demonstrated through reference and citation practices: LIS scholars now cite and receive citations from other fields more than from LIS itself. Two major structural shifts are revealed in the data: in 1960, LIS changed from a professional field focused on librarianship to an academic field focused on information and use; and in 1990, LIS began to receive a growing number of citations from outside the field, notably from Computer Science and Management, and saw a dramatic increase in the number of authors contributing to the literature of the field.},

A survey was sent to approximately 15,000 faculty, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers at four large North American research universities with a response rate of 14.4\% (n = 2021). Respondents were asked to rate how eight different journal attributes and five different audiences influence their choice of publication output. Within the sample, the most highly rated attributes are quality and reputation of journal and fit with the scope of the journal; open access is the least important attribute. Researchers at other research-intensive institutions are considered the most important audience, while the general public is the least important. There are significant differences across subject disciplines and position types. Our findings have implications for understanding the adoption of open access publishing models.},

The paper explores the ways in which these multiple overlapping communities intersect with the journal landscape and the implications for the adoption and use of new players in the scholarly communication system, particularly open-access mega-journals (OAMJs). OAMJs (e.g. PLOS ONE and Scientific Reports) are large, broad scope, open-access journals that base editorial decisions solely on the technical/scientific soundness of the article. Design/methodology/approach Focus groups with active researchers in these fields were held in five UK Higher Education Institutions across Great Britain, and were complemented by interviews with pro-vice-chancellors for research at each institution. Findings A strong finding to emerge from the data is the notion of researchers belonging to multiple overlapping communities, with some inherent tensions in meeting the requirements for these different audiences. Researcher perceptions of evaluation mechanisms were found to play a major role in attitudes towards OAMJs, and interviews with the pro-vice-chancellors for research indicate that there is a difference between researchers' perceptions and the values embedded in institutional frameworks. Originality/value This is the first purely qualitative study relating to researcher perspectives on OAMJs. The findings of the paper will be of interest to publishers, policy-makers, research managers and academics.},

	abstract = {Background: Biomedical journals are the main route for disseminating the results of health-related research. Despite this, their editors operate largely without formal training or certification. To our knowledge, no body of literature systematically identifying core competencies for scientific editors of biomedical journals exists. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a scoping review to determine what is known on the competency requirements for scientific editors of biomedical journals. Methods: We searched the MEDLINE (R), Cochrane Library, Embase (R), CINAHL, PsycINFO, and ERIC databases (from inception to November 2014) and conducted a grey literature search for research and non-research articles with competency-related statements (i.e. competencies, knowledge, skills, behaviors, and tasks) pertaining to the role of scientific editors of peer-reviewed health-related journals. We also conducted an environmental scan, searched the results of a previous environmental scan, and searched the websites of existing networks, major biomedical journal publishers, and organizations that offer resources for editors. Results: A total of 225 full-text publications were included, 25 of which were research articles. We extracted a total of 1,566 statements possibly related to core competencies for scientific editors of biomedical journals from these publications. We then collated overlapping or duplicate statements which produced a list of 203 unique statements. Finally, we grouped these statements into seven emergent themes: (1) dealing with authors, (2) dealing with peer reviewers, (3) journal publishing, (4) journal promotion, (5) editing, (6) ethics and integrity, and (7) qualities and characteristics of editors. Discussion: To our knowledge, this scoping review is the first attempt to systematically identify possible competencies of editors. Limitations are that (1) we may not have captured all aspects of a biomedical editor's work in our searches, (2) removing redundant and overlapping items may have led to the elimination of some nuances between items, (3) restricting to certain databases, and only French and English publications, may have excluded relevant publications, and (4) some statements may not necessarily be competencies. Conclusion: This scoping review is the first step of a program to develop a minimum set of core competencies for scientific editors of biomedical journals which will be followed by a training needs assessment, a Delphi exercise, and a consensus meeting.},

The way a journal reflects the internationalized nature of science may be determined by many methods, one of which is based on the distribution of authoring and citing countries. This can be systematically measured either by a comparison of these distributions with averages profiles of a discipline or specialty, or by concentration indexes on the other. This paper focuses on the first approach. As the average profile of science drifts with the level of visibility, stratification by impact level is discussed. In this study, experimental internationalization indexes were calculated on the SCI for journals belonging to Earth\&Space and Applied Biology. Convergence of measurements (types of indexes, type of normalization, publication vs citation scope) is adressed. Internationalization indexes may have a variety of applications, including characterization of the scientific publishing market and sampling of the SCI for science indicators.},

Research on ‘world cities’ develops the idea that interconnected agglomerations can better take advantage of international competition. Thus, the increasing concentration of activities in these cities at the expense of others could be observed by certain scholars using measures based on scientific publications. Others, however, show that an opposite trend is emerging: the largest cities are undergoing a relative decline in a country’s scientific activities. To go beyond this seeming contradiction, this paper provides a global analysis of all countries with papers in the Web of Science over the period 1987–2007. The author’s addresses were geocoded and grouped into agglomerations. Registering of papers was based on the fractional counting of multi-authored publications, and the results are unambiguous: deconcentration is the dominant trend both globally and within countries, with some exceptions for which explanations are suggested.},

Using data from the Science Citation Index Expanded, scientific authors’ addresses are geo-localized and grouped by urban areas. Our data suggests that interurban collaborations within countries increased together with international linkages. In most countries, domestic collaborations increased faster than international collaborations. Even among the top collaborating cities, sometimes referred to as “world cities”, the share of domestic collaborations has gained momentum. Our results suggest that, contrary to common beliefs about the globalization process, national systems of research have been strengthening during the 2000s.},

As boundaries between disciplines are crossed, and as research engages more with stakeholders in complex systems, traditional academic definitions and criteria of research quality are no longer sufficient-there is a need for a parallel evolution of principles and criteria to define and evaluate research quality in a transdisciplinary research (TDR) context. We conducted a systematic review to help answer the question: What are appropriate principles and criteria for defining and assessing TDR quality? Articles were selected and reviewed seeking: arguments for or against expanding definitions of research quality, purposes for research quality evaluation, proposed principles of research quality, proposed criteria for research quality assessment, proposed indicators and measures of research quality, and proposed processes for evaluating TDR. We used the information from the review and our own experience in two research organizations that employ TDR approaches to develop a prototype TDR quality assessment framework, organized as an evaluation rubric. We provide an overview of the relevant literature and summarize the main aspects of TDR quality identified there. Four main principles emerge: relevance, including social significance and applicability; credibility, including criteria of integration and reflexivity, added to traditional criteria of scientific rigor; legitimacy, including criteria of inclusion and fair representation of stakeholder interests, and; effectiveness, with criteria that assess actual or potential contributions to problem solving and social change.},

The overall aim was therefore to describe what constitutes research, and then to use this description to develop a model of research practice and to define concepts related to its quality. The primary objective was to explore such a model and to create a multidisciplinary understanding of the generic dimensions of the quality of research practice. Eight concept modelling working seminars were conducted. A graphic representation of concepts and their relationships was developed to bridge the gap between different disciplines. A concept model of research as a phenomenon was created, which included a total of 18 defined concepts and their relationships. In a second phase four main areas were distilled, describing research practice in a multidisciplinary context: Credible, Contributory, Communicable, and Conforming. Each of these was further specified in a concept hierarchy together with a defined terminology. A comprehensive quality model including 32 concepts, based on the four main areas, was developed for describing quality issues of research practice, where the model of research as a phenomenon was used to define the quality concepts. The quality model may be used for further development of elements, weights and operationalizations related to the quality of research practice in different academic fields. (C) 2015 The Authors.

This article studies the implementation of bibliometric measures for allocating resources at Swedish universities. Several models and indicators based on publications, citations, and research grants are identified. The design of performance-based resource allocation across major universities is then analysed using a framework from the field of evaluation studies. The practical implementation, the incentives as well as the 'ethics' of models and indicators, are scrutinized in order to provide a theoretically informed assessment of evaluation systems. It is evident that the requirements, goals, possible consequences, and the costs of evaluation are scarcely discussed before these systems are implemented. We find that allocation models are implemented in response to a general trend of assessment across all types of activities and organizations, but the actual design of evaluation systems is dependent on size, orientation, and the overall organization of the institution in question.},

	abstract = {The experiences from Australia where undifferentiated publication counts were linked to funding of universities in 1993 is well known. Publication activity increased, but the largest increase was in lower-impact journals, leading to a general drop in overall citation impact for Australia. The experience from Australia has been a warning for what would most likely happen if funding were linked to publication activity. Nevertheless, in 2005, a performance-based model based on differentiated publication counts was implemented in Norway. The model was specifically developed to counter adverse effects like those identified in the Australian case. In the present article, we examine 'what happens at the aggregated level of publication and citation activity when funding is linked to differentiated publication counts'. We examine developments in Norwegian publication activity, journal publication profiles, and citation impact. We also examine developments in publication activities at the individual level and developments in research and development resource inputs. We compare experiences in Australia to those in Norway. The results show that for the Norwegian case, overall publication activity goes up, impact remains stable, and there is no indication of a deliberate displacement of journal publication activities to the lowest-impact journals. Hence, we do not see the same patterns as in Australia. We conclude that the experience in Norway with differentiated publication counts linked to funding has been different from the experience in Australia with an undifferentiated model. This is an important observation because currently the Norwegian model is being or has been adopted in several European countries.},

	abstract = {Scientists have long since become accustomed to explaining the future value of their work. Nowadays token statements are no longer sufficient. Societal impact must be embedded in the organisation of research. The call for societal impact is most explicitly expressed in and actively shaped by trans disciplinary research programmes. We have examined two questions related to compliance in the principal-agent relation between a programme and its projects. The first question concerns the risk of moral hazard: is societal actor involvement a token activity or a substantial component of the research process? The second question relates to possible adverse selection: does societal actor involvement produce the expected benefits and, if so, under which conditions? We surveyed members and project leaders of 178 projects in two transdisciplinary climate research programmes in The Netherlands. There is no reason to suspect large-scale moral hazard. Projects formally labelled as transdisciplinary have characteristics typically associated with transdisciplinarity but academic projects share those characteristics. Neither is there reason to suspect adverse selection. The archetypical properties of transdisciplinary research are associated with the expected societal benefits. An important finding is that there are different types of benefit, each of which requires its own approach. Benefit is achieved through informal involvement and a diversity of outputs, and much less by giving societal actors a prominent role or influence in the research process. Based on our conclusions we recommend customizing the design of climate research programmes and projects towards the needs of the specific societal benefits they aim to generate and reconsidering the emphasis on formal involvement of societal actors in funding procedures.

First, both within each of 22 broad fields and in the all-sciences case, citation inequality is strongly affected by the presence of a handful of extreme observations, particularly when it is measured by citation inequality indices that are very sensitive to citation differences in the upper tail of citation distributions. Second, the impact of extreme observations on citation averages is generally much smaller.

The comparison is based on interviews with 29 scholars who have experience with identifying talent both in their daily academic work and in the process of grant allocation. Overall, there is large agreement on the notion of talent. However, the characteristics ascribed to top talent vary depending on the evaluation context. In grant allocation, a narrower talent definition prevails compared with more general evaluation. Furthermore, difficulties arise in the process of panel decision-making, when selection criteria need to be concrete and explicit to enable comparison. Having to choose between many applicants of similar quality makes the selection process liable to subjectivity, arbitrariness, and randomness. Despite these uncertainties, grants are ascribed a very high symbolic value. Small quality differences are enlarged into considerable differences in recognition, consequently affecting career opportunities, as they provide academics with both financial and symbolic resources.},

The unit of analysis is the project beneficiary, and research cooperation is an explicit prerequisite for obtaining public funding. The novelty of the article lies in the combination of a refined setting of breadth, composition, and depth of research networks at project level.

	abstract = {There is an increasing interest in demonstrating the outcomes from research for the purposes of learning, accountability, or to demonstrate the value of research investments. However, assessing the impact of social science research on policy and practice is challenging. The ways in which research is taken up, used, and reused in policy and practice settings means that linking research processes or outputs to wider changes is difficult, and timescales are hard to predict. This article proposes an empirically grounded framework for assessing the impact of research the Research Contribution Framework. A case study approach was adopted to explore the nature of research impact and how it might be assessed. Findings were used to design, develop, and test a framework to assess the contribution of research to relevant areas of policy and practice and to articulate wider benefits. The framework has been adapted from contribution analysis, using the idea of 'contribution' to help explain the ways research is taken up and used to influence policy and practice. The framework allows for a focus on the roles of research users, and examines both processes and outcomes. It is argued that this approach gets round some of the common problems in assessing impact. It provides a method of linking research and knowledge exchange to wider outcomes whilst acknowledging and including contextual factors that help or hinder research impact. It is practical, balancing robustness with feasibility. It is adaptable for a wide range of content, types of impact assessment, and purposes.},

However, as panel reviewing entails social interaction, group dynamics influence these processes. By adding insights from social psychology to current knowledge on panel reviews, we are better able to identify factors affecting talent selection and funding decisions in grant panels. By opening up this so-called black box, we aim to contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics of panel decision making. This knowledge is also relevant for various stakeholders involved in grant allocation, for applicants, reviewers, and policymakers, as it can be used to improve transparency, fairness, and legitimation of talent selection processes.},

The greatest weaknesses of reputational platforms were a lack of trustworthiness and being open to gaming. The large majority of researchers, despite some reservations, thought that reputational systems were here to stay and will become increasingly important in the future, and especially for younger researchers.},

Authors examined not only team rosters but also the project rosters (167 projects for 2012) of each team to calculate disciplinary diversity. Results suggest that the intended diversity is being achieved for some teams.

For egocentric networks we focus on the characteristics of tie strength and tie configuration, and knowledge creation is assessed by the number of citations. Using a panel of 1042 American scientists in five disciplines and fixed effects models, we found an inverted U-shaped relationship between network average tie strength and citation impact, because an increase in tie strength on the one hand facilitates the collaborative knowledge creation process and on the other hand decreases cognitive diversity. In addition, when the network average tie strength is high, a more skewed network performs better because it still has a "healthy" mixture of weak and strong ties and a balance between exploration and exploitation. Furthermore, the tie strength skewness moderates the effect of network average tie strength: both the initial positive effect and the later negative effect of an increase in tie strength are smaller in a more skewed network than in a less skewed one.

	abstract = {Science is increasingly organized in large-scale science centers. Expectations are that center-based research should yield qualitatively different research than single-investigator-produced research, but demonstrating the particular effects of a center is challenging. The notion of 'centerness' is that science centers can yield findings that reflect conceptual collisions across disciplinary or geographic boundaries between a center's scientific members. Collaborative research commonly is assessed using co-authorships of scientific publications. Co-authorship measures can be conveniently and unobtrusively operationalized, yet they can yield indicators (especially for a small center) showing little change in collaboration in a center-context, while richer findings of collaboration are evidenced in observing other aspects of center members' behavior. This article puts forth the use of social network analysis and bibliographic coupling as measures of 'centerness' and presents their characteristics in the context of an National Science Foundation (NSF) science center. Bibliographic coupling is characterized as a measure of centerness over the time period of the establishment of an NSF-funded science center. We also examine changes in bibliographic coupling indicators alongside changes in co-authorship networks and a social network survey of center participants. Bibliographic coupling is shown to make a distinctive contribution to measurement of centerness, demonstrating increasing coupling from the pre-center and since-center periods. This increase in centerness as represented in bibliographic coupling does not dramatically change when self-citations are removed. Overall, results show this to be a useful and consistent measure of centerness and knowledge coalescence within the research center environment.},

Most of these studies focus on the respective peer review system by bibliometrically investigating its ability to select the 'best' applicants for funding, although they come to different results. However, an overview of the studies reveals that potential differences in the past publication performance between approved and rejected applicants depend not only on selection decisions (or the peer review) but also on further programme-specific factors such as finiteness/openness of the overall budget and the level of self-or 'pre-selection' amongst potential applicants. As the European Research Council Starting Grants is a highly prestigious international funding programme for young scientists with demanding eligibility requirements and low acceptance rates, it constitutes a unique case study for further investigating the relationship between peer review-based selection decisions and applicants' publication performance.},

This study concluded that women and men have the same probability to achieve a postdoctoral fellowship and that among men and women who have achieved this we observed that they had equal chances of becoming professors. However, it was also shown that women are substantially worse off than men for the study group of those who have not achieved a postdoctoral fellowship.

In this article, we use 22 different journal weighting schemes to generate output estimates of refereed journal article and page production for three 6-year periods (1994-9; 2000-5 and 2006-11). These periods reflect a pre-PBRF environment, a mixed assessment period, and a pure PBRF research environment, respectively. Our findings indicate that, on average, research productivity, defined in either article or page terms, has increased since the introduction of the PBRF. However, this outcome is due to a major increase in the quantity of articles and pages produced per capita that has more than off-set a decline in the quality of published outputs since the introduction of the PBRF. In other words, our findings suggest that the PBRF has failed to achieve its stated goal of increasing average research quality, but it has resulted in substantial gains in productivity achieved via large increases in the quantity of refereed journal articles.},

Impact comes in numerous forms, however, so its assessment is far from straightforward.

	abstract = {While numerous qualitative social scientific analyses of (environmental) epigenetics have been published, we still lack a macro-level, quantitative assessment of the field of epigenetics as a whole. This article is aimed at filling this gap. Mobilizing an extended version of the Web of Science, we constituted a corpus of 199,484 documents (articles, reviews, editorial material, etc.) published between 1991 and 2017 and performed several scientometric analyses to map out the development and structure of the epigenetics field. Three main results were drawn from these investigations. First, contradicting the hope expressed by some social scientists that their disciplines will find solace in epigenetics’ social biology, it is striking that the scientists, journals and institutions that drive most of the research in the field are overall little concerned with social and environmental dimensions of gene expression. Second, and confirming existing qualitative analyses, we find that epigenetics is constituted by diverse networks of scholars, institutions and research specialties that enjoy relative autonomy from each other and approach epigenetics through different thematic interests, from cognitive functions to cancer, to DNA methylation in plants and molecular biology. Third, findings obtained from the bibliographic coupling showed that these different networks became more and more autonomous over the last decade, which suggests that we are currently witnessing the constitution of a scientific archipelago akin to that of behavior genetics (Panofsky, 2014: 33) rather than to a discipline per se. At the same time, this differentiation was less pronounced conceptually speaking, as we also observed a clear standardization of the keywords used in epigenetics articles between 1991 and 2017, with DNA methylation and RNAs serving as rallying signs for different communities of researchers.},

	abstract = {Science’s main norms prescribe scientists to use citations as acknowledgements of cognitive content irrespective of geographical location. Previous studies, however, suggested that there is a considerable geographical bias in scientific citations. We argue that this geographical bias does not, in itself, falsify the notion that citations reflect acknowledgement of cognitive content, because cognitively related knowledge may be geographically concentrated as well. We analyse the role of organizational, regional and national co-location on citation likelihood for 5.5 million article pairs, and find that the geographical bias in citations is weak once cognitive relatedness is accounted for. Furthermore, we find that the effect of co-location on citation likelihood is strongest at the organizational level, weaker at the regional level, and weakest at the national level. In addition, we show that geographical co-location particularly increases the citation likelihood between two papers when knowledge relatedness between articles is low, suggesting that interdisciplinary research benefits most from co-location. Finally, we find that, when knowledge relatedness is high, the effect of geographical co-location on citation likelihood is non-existent. We discuss the implications regarding policies aimed to discourage strategic citations and to foster interdisciplinary research.},

	abstract = {The publication of special issues constitute an important yet underinvestigated phenomenon of scholarly communication. In an attempt to draw attention to the proliferation of special issues, Priem (2006) suggested that their commissioning has an underestimated opportunity cost, given the relative scarcity of publication space: by distorting the “marketplace for ideas” through the commanding of preselected topical distributions, special issues undermine the total research output by “squeezing out” high-quality but topically unrelated articles. The present paper attempts to test this hypothesis by providing a topicality and research impact analysis of conference-based, monographic, and regular issues published between 2010 and 2015 inclusive and indexed in Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science. The results show that the titles and abstracts of articles copublished are topically closer to each other than those copublished in regular issues, which suggests that their relative importance might influence the total topical distribution. However, disciplinary and overall comparison of relative citations for both special and regular issues shows that intraissue averages and variances in the former case are respectively higher and lower than in the regular issue context, which undermines not only the abovementioned hypothesis, but also the belief that editors often “fill up” special issues by accepting substandard papers.},

	abstract = {Null hypothesis statistical significance tests (NHST) are widely used in quantitative research in the empirical sciences including scientometrics. Nevertheless, since their introduction nearly a century ago significance tests have been controversial. Many researchers are not aware of the numerous criticisms raised against NHST. As practiced, NHST has been characterized as a ‘null ritual’ that is overused and too often misapplied and misinterpreted. NHST is in fact a patchwork of two fundamentally different classical statistical testing models, often blended with some wishful quasi-Bayesian interpretations. This is undoubtedly a major reason why NHST is very often misunderstood. But NHST also has intrinsic logical problems and the epistemic range of the information provided by such tests is much more limited than most researchers recognize. In this article we introduce to the scientometric community the theoretical origins of NHST, which is mostly absent from standard statistical textbooks, and we discuss some of the most prevalent problems relating to the practice of NHST and trace these problems back to the mix-up of the two different theoretical origins. Finally, we illustrate some of the misunderstandings with examples from the scientometric literature and bring forward some modest recommendations for a more sound practice in quantitative data analysis.},

	abstract = {A classic thesis is that scientific achievement exhibits a “Matthew effect”: Scientists who have previously been successful are more likely to succeed again, producing increasing distinction. We investigate to what extent the Matthew effect drives the allocation of research funds. To this end, we assembled a dataset containing all review scores and funding decisions of grant proposals submitted by recent PhDs in a €2 billion granting program. Analyses of review scores reveal that early funding success introduces a growing rift, with winners just above the funding threshold accumulating more than twice as much research funding (€180,000) during the following eight years as nonwinners just below it. We find no evidence that winners’ improved funding chances in subsequent competitions are due to achievements enabled by the preceding grant, which suggests that early funding itself is an asset for acquiring later funding. Surprisingly, however, the emergent funding gap is partly created by applicants, who, after failing to win one grant, apply for another grant less often.},

The peer review process can also introduce bias. A compelling ethical and moral rationale necessitates improving the peer review process. A double-blind peer review system is supported on equipoise and fair-play principles. Triple- and quadruple-blind systems have also been described but are not commonly used. The open peer review system introduces "\textit{Skin in the Game}" heuristic principles for both authors and reviewers and has a small favorable effect on the quality of published reports. In this exposition, we present, on the basis of a comprehensive literature search of PubMed from its inception until October 20, 2017, various possible mechanisms by which the peer review process can distort research results, and we discuss the evidence supporting different strategies that may mitigate this bias. It is time to improve the quality, transparency, and accountability of the peer review system.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

For 1,689 funded research projects an ex-post peer evaluation (EXPOST) was also available; for the rest of the grant applications a multilevel missing data imputation approach was used to consider verification bias for the first time in peer-review research. Without imputation, the predictive validity of EXANTE was low (r=.26) but underestimated due to verification bias, and with imputation it was r=.49. That is, the decision-making procedure is capable of selecting the best research proposals for funding. In the EXANTE there were several potential biases (e.g., gender). With respect to the EXPOST there was only one real bias (discipline-specific and year-specific differential prediction). The novelty of this contribution is, first, the combining of theoretical concepts of validity and fairness with a missing data imputation approach to correct for verification bias and, second, multilevel modeling to test peer review-based funding decisions for both validity and fairness in terms of potential and real biases.},

This article notes that controversy and uncertainty are central characteristics of potentially groundbreaking research proposals. The selection of truly innovative research is constrained by the boundaries on current knowledge, against which the value of proposed research is judged; these boundaries affect the extent to which peer review panellists feel they can take risks in their judgments and the rules of interpretation and deliberation they adopt. The role of customary interpretative rules is to limit the risks involved in decision making.

In addition, the notion of bias is predicated on an implicit ideal that, once articulated, raises questions about the normative implications of research on bias in peer review. This review provides a brief description of the function, history, and scope of peer review; articulates and critiques the conception of bias unifying research on bias in peer review; characterizes and examines the empirical, methodological, and normative claims of bias in peer review research; and assesses possible alternatives to the status quo.

Second, a content analysis of written reviews indicates that certain elements of peer culture from the 17th century are still active in the scientific community. These arguments are illustrated by a case study on the peer review practices of a national funding institution, the Swiss National Science Foundation. Based on the case study and the two arguments it will be concluded more generally that peer review procedures show a distinctive specificity to the reviewed objects (e.g. papers or proposals), the organizational format (e.g. panels or external reviewers), or the surrounding context (e.g. disciplinary or interdisciplinary). Scientists, administrators, and the public may conclude that appraising peer review procedures should not be done by way of general principles but should be based on concrete factual knowledge on the specific process under discussion.},

In this substantive-methodological synergy, we demonstrate methodological and multilevel statistical approaches to testing a null hypothesis model in relation to the effect of researcher gender on peer reviews of grant proposals, based on 10,023 reviews by 6233 external assessors of 2331 proposals from social science, humanities, and science disciplines. Utilizing multilevel cross-classified models, we show that support for the null hypothesis model positing researcher gender has no significant effect on proposal outcomes. Furthermore, these non-effects of gender generalize over assessor gender (contrary to a matching hypothesis), discipline, assessors chosen by the researchers themselves compared to those chosen by the funding agency, and country of the assessor. Given the large, diverse sample, the powerful statistical analyses, and support for generalizability, these results - coupled with findings from previous research - offer strong support for the null hypothesis model of no gender differences in peer reviews of grant proposals.

	abstract = {Psychometrics questions the use of dichotomous decisions. For these reasons, De Los Reyes and Wang (2012) favour a continuous funding decision system, in which the funded percentage of a requested grant sum is coupled to the ratings that a proposal receives in the ex ante peer evaluation. In contrast to the 'winner takes all' philosophy in a dichotomous funding decision system, a continuous system takes the low reliability of peer review ratings into account. Funding decisions are mostly based on peer review rating systems that have rather low inter-rater reliability. This article aims to use psychometrics to simulate the two funding decision systems, to compare them to the funding decision system implemented by a real funding organization, and with this, to investigate for the first time the effects of measurement errors on funding decisions. We used peer review data from the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) (N = 8,496 proposals), which obviously implements a hybrid funding decision system. The approval rate at FWF is 44.5\%; our findings show that the approval rate would be 32.1\% using a purely dichotomous system and 58.4\% using a continuous funding decision system. As the funded percentage of a proposal's requested grant sum increases with increasing mean ex ante peer evaluation of a proposal (r = 0.23), the FWF also shows elements of a continuous funding decision system. Relative to a continuous system, a dichotomous system reduces the approval probability of a proposal overall. This is even the case for high-quality proposals (approval probability similar to 0.70).},

In this study, data from 6,393 applications submitted between 2011 and 2015 to the Belgian funding agency Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique -FNRS (F.R.S.-FNRS) were statistically analysed to highlight any possible effect of gender on success rates. Results show no significant influence of gender on success rates or the likelihood of getting funding for most of the funding schemes we analysed. Research credit (RC) was the only one where gender and success variables were statistically dependent, although mean success rates of male and female applicants were not significantly different. Average grades given by remote reviewers to male applicants were significantly higher in the frame of RC applications. Among RC applications, the difference in success rates was higher in Humanities and Social Sciences, followed by Exact and Natural Sciences, and finally Life and Health Sciences. Proportions of male researchers who apply were shown to be higher for most of the funding schemes analysed, mainly for grant applications (such as RC) where only tenure researchers are allowed to apply. Taken together, our results show that access to F.R.S.-FNRS funding is not gender-dependent for the majority of the funding schemes except one where men represent the vast majority of the applicants. Reasons that could explain this statistical dependence are under investigation and could be due to the lower grading of women by remote reviewers.},

A comprehensive model of the journal selection process is developed, including 39 detailed considerations spread over three major categories: likelihood of timely acceptance; potential impact of the manuscript (journal credibility, prestige, visibility); and philosophical and ethical issues. Specific guidelines are given for evaluating such concepts as manuscript-journal “fit,” journal prestige, and journal visibility. The graphical model developed here assists authors in comparing journal alternatives and provides new researchers with insights into how the three primary journal selection categories are weighed and balanced. In addition, less commonly understood concepts, such as Time to Publication, Review Cycle Time Delay, and Publication Time Delay, are identified and named, and their relationships are defined in this article. On a broader level, this research demonstrates that scholars across disciplines have substantial common interests with respect to journal publishing, that the ties that unite academics seeking to publish are strong, and that the potential for future crossdisciplinary research in the area of how academics inform one another is correspondingly robust.},

Fifty percent of the librarians in this study considered free open access when selecting a potential journal for publication, but a journal's fit to the topic and peer review were higher priorities. Findings indicate that, although many librarians publish in open access journals or take advantage of institutional repositories, there are still barriers to publishing in open access journals, including article processing charges, the tenure and promotion culture, and uncertainty around intellectual property rights.},

Thus, the purpose of this descriptive research was to review the typology and dissemination rates of journals currently available in CTE as a means to clarify their role and impact in the field. The review resulted in the identification of 17 journals mediating the diffusion of research information in the United States and internationally. Further, over the past 10 years (2008-2017), a consistent rate of dissemination was observed as a whole, but variable for individual journals.

This study focuses on how this differs according to the geographical location of the researcher, specifically in terms of the country's level of development. Data were collected by a questionnaire survey of 3650 authors who had published articles in international journals. The human development index (HDI) was used to compare authors' scholarly behavior. The findings show that researchers from less developed countries such as India and China (medium HDI) compared to those in developed countries, such as the USA and UK (very high HDI) are more reliant on external factors and those criteria that are related to authority, brand and reputation, such as authors' names, affiliation, country and journal name. Even when deciding where to publish, the publisher of the journal is more important for developing countries than it is for researchers from the US and UK. Scholars from high HDI countries also differ in these aspects: a) they are less discriminatory than authors from developing countries in their citation practices; b) for them the fact that a source is peer reviewed is the most important factor when deciding where to publish; c) they are more negative towards the use of repositories and social media for publishing and more skeptical about their potential for increasing usage or reaching a wider audience.},

At the operational level, while both head and tail fits of zipfian word distributions are more independent of corpus size than other lexical diversity indicators, the latter however neatly outperforms the former in that regard. This benchmark-setting performance of zipfian distribution tails proves extremely handy in distinguishing actual patterns in lexical diversity from the statistical noise generated by other indicators due to corpus size fluctuations. From an empirical perspective, analysis of Web of Science (WoS) article titles from 1975 to 2014 shows that the lexical concentration of scholarly titles in Natural Sciences \& Engineering (NSE) and Social Sciences \& Humanities (SSH) articles increases by a little less than 8\% over the whole period. With the exception of the lexically concentrated Mathematics, Earth \& Space, and Physics, NSE article titles all increased in lexical concentration, suggesting a probable convergence of concentration levels in the near future. As regards to SSH disciplines, aggregation effects observed at the disciplinary group level suggests that, behind the stable concentration levels of SSH disciplines, a cross-disciplinary homogenization of the highest word frequency ranks may be at work. Overall, these trends suggest a progressive standardization of title wording in scientific article titles, as article titles get written using an increasingly restricted and cross-disciplinary set of words.},

	abstract = {Social media are computer-mediated technologies that facilitate the exchange of research outcomes and make them available to larger audiences and networks. As a result, researchers are gradually integrating these tools into their everyday workflow. This phenomenon has contributed to the development of alternative impact indicators or altmetrics. Most of the research in the area of altmetrics was focused on describing the relationship between social media indicators and bibliometric indicators. In 2016, Henk Moed argued that web-based indicators “do not have function merely in the evaluation of research performance of individuals and groups, but also in the research process”. This statement motivates us to go beyond the evaluative perspective of altmetrics to a more contextualized perspective in which the study of the citing, publishing, and tweeting activities of researchers on Web of Science is compared. Results show that, at the individual researcher level, Twitter-based indicators are empirically different from production-based and citation-based bibliometric indicators. The results of this chapter should be seen as a first step towards a conceptual shift from a mere study of the reception of publications on Twitter to a more dynamic perspective that focuses on the social media activities of researchers as part of their computerization of the scientific process. Future research directions based on the findings presented in this study are also suggested.},

However, an additional focus on research on the quadruple and quintuple helix models has emerged in the more specialised literature.

	abstract = {The Triple Helix innovation model focuses on university-industry-government relations. The Quadruple Helix embeds the Triple Helix by adding as a fourth helix the ‘media-based and culture-based public’ and ‘civil society’. The Quintuple Helix innovation model is even broader and more comprehensive by contextualizing the Quadruple Helix and by additionally adding the helix (and perspective) of the ‘natural environments of society’. The Triple Helix acknowledges explicitly the importance of higher education for innovation. However, in one line of interpretation it could be argued that the Triple Helix places the emphasis on knowledge production and innovation in the economy so it is compatible with the knowledge economy. The Quadruple Helix already encourages the perspective of the knowledge society, and of knowledge democracy for knowledge production and innovation. In a Quadruple Helix understanding, the sustainable development of a knowledge economy requires a coevolution with the knowledge society. The Quintuple Helix stresses the necessary socioecological transition of society and economy in the twenty-first century; therefore, the Quintuple Helix is ecologically sensitive. Within the framework of the Quintuple Helix innovation model, the natural environments of society and the economy also should be seen as drivers for knowledge production and innovation, therefore defining opportunities for the knowledge economy. The European Commission in 2009 identified the socioecological transition as a major challenge for the future roadmap of development. The Quintuple Helix supports here the formation of a win-win situation between ecology, knowledge and innovation, creating synergies between economy, society, and democracy. Global warming represents an area of ecological concern, to which the Quintuple Helix innovation model can be applied with greater potential.},

In the study, the outcomes of a literature review of 235 RRI-related articles were presented. The articles were selected from the EBSCO and Google Scholar databases regarding the definitions and dimensions of RRI. The results of the study indicated that while administrative definitions were widely quoted in the reviewed literature, they were not substantially further elaborated. Academic definitions were mostly derived from the institutional definitions; however, more empirical studies should be conducted in order to give a broader empirical basis to the development of the concept. In the current study, four distinct conceptual dimensions of RRI that appeared in the reviewed literature were brought out: inclusion, anticipation, responsiveness and reflexivity. Two emerging conceptual dimensions were also added: sustainability and care.},

Here, we provide an overview of how and why citizens become (and sometimes remain) misinformed about science. Our discussion focuses specifically on misinformation among individual citizens. However, it is impossible to understand individual information processing and acceptance without taking into account social networks, information ecologies, and other macro-level variables that provide important social context. Specifically, we show how being misinformed is a function of a person’s ability and motivation to spot falsehoods, but also of other group-level and societal factors that increase the chances of citizens to be exposed to correct(ive) information. We conclude by discussing a number of research areas—some of which echo themes of the 2017 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s Communicating Science Effectively report—that will be particularly important for our future understanding of misinformation, specifically a systems approach to the problem of misinformation, the need for more systematic analyses of science communication in new media environments, and a (re)focusing on traditionally underserved audiences.},

This study mobilizes four recent studies to further elaborate the concept of undone science as it relates to the political construction of research agendas. Using these cases, we develop the argument that undone science is part of a broader politics of knowledge, wherein multiple and competing groups struggle over the construction and implementation of alternative research agendas. Overall, the study demonstrates the analytic potential of the concept of undone science to deepen understanding of the systematic nonproduction of knowledge in the institutional matrix of state, industry, and social movements that is characteristic of recent calls for a ‘‘new political sociology of science.’’},

A review of research articles produced in the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic shows that COVID-19 research had smaller teams and involved fewer nations than pre-COVID-19 coronavirus research. The United States and China were, and continue to be in the pandemic era, at the center of the global network in coronavirus related research, while developing countries are relatively absent from early research activities in the COVID-19 period. Not only are China and the United States at the center of the global network of coronavirus research, but they strengthen their bilateral research relationship during COVID-19, producing more than 4.9\% of all global articles together, in contrast to 3.6\% before the pandemic. In addition, in the COVID-19 period, joined by the United Kingdom, China and the United States continued their roles as the largest contributors to, and home to the main funders of, coronavirus related research. These findings suggest that the global COVID-19 pandemic shifted the geographic loci of coronavirus research, as well as the structure of scientific teams, narrowing team membership and favoring elite structures. These findings raise further questions over the decisions that scientists face in the formation of teams to maximize a speed, skill trade-off. Policy implications are discussed.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic presented a challenge to the global research community as they rushed to find solutions to the devastating crisis. Drawing expectations from resilience theory, this paper explores how the trajectory of coronavirus research was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Using terms featured in articles in early COVID-19 research, and pathways of knowledge characterized through term extraction, evolutionary pathways and statistical analysis, the results reveal that the pandemic disrupted existing lines of coronavirus research to a large degree. While broad communities of coronavirus research are similar pre- and during COVID-19, topics themselves change significantly and there is less cohesion amongst early COVID-19 research compared to that within research before the pandemic. We find that some lines of research revert to research pursued almost a decade earlier, whilst others pursue brand new trajectories, and that Chinese researchers in particular appear to be driving the more novel research. These findings suggest that the global research community maintained a similar broad research focus from before the pandemic, but shifted the detail of the research in the COVID-19 period, exploring diverse pathways, and that specific actors are more flexible than others in doing so. The findings raise further questions about whether the shifts are advantageous for global scientific progress, and whether the research community will return to the original equilibrium or reorganize into a different knowledge configuration.},

To answer this crucial question systematically we need to contrast indicators of research priorities with indicators of societal needs. We focus on rice research and technology between 1983 and 2012. We combine quantitative methods that allow investigation of the relation between ‘revealed’ research priorities and ‘revealed’ societal demands, measured respectively by research output (publications) and national accounts of rice use and farmers’ and consumers’ rice-related needs. We employ new bibliometric data, methods and indicators to identify countries’ main rice research topics (priorities) from publications. For a panel of countries, we estimate the relation between revealed research priorities and revealed demands. We find that, across countries and time, societal demands explain a country's research trajectory to a limited extent. Some research priorities are nicely aligned to societal demands, confirming that science is partly related to societal needs. However, we find a relevant number of misalignments between the focus of rice research and revealed demands, crucially related to human consumption and nutrition. We discuss some implications for research policy.},

	abstract = {Since outbreaks in 2003, avian influenza has received a considerable amount of funding and become a controversial science policy issue in various respects. Like in many other global and multidisciplinary societal problems fraught with high levels of uncertainty, a variety of perspectives have emerged over how to “tackle” avian influenza and public voices have expressed concern over how research funds are being allocated. In this article, we document if and how research agendas are being informed by public policy debates. We use qualitative and quantitative approaches to examine the relations between expectations of outcomes of public science and the existing research landscape. Interviews with a cross-section of stakeholders reveal a wide range of perspectives and values associated with the nature and objectives of existing research avenues. We find that the landscape of public avian influenza research is not directly driven by expectations of societal outcomes. Instead, it is shaped by three institutional drivers: pharmaceutical industry priorities, publishing and public research funding pressures, and the mandates of science-based policy or public health organizations. These insights suggest that, in research prioritization, funding agencies should embrace a broad perspective of research governance that explicitly considers underlying institutional drivers. Deliberative approaches in public priority setting might help to make agendas more plural and diverse and thus more responsive to the contested and uncertain nature of avian influenza research.},

	abstract = {This paper locates the discussion around the finalization thesis in a broader science policy context, linking it to the recent discourse on a changing science-society contract. It is argued that the broadening of the Kuhnian concept of the paradigm, making it amenable to science policy studies, was an important move. Further development of this notion, however, standed on the prongs of critique coming from both the worlds of politics and science. At the same time, advances in the cognitive sociology of science undermined the internalist/externalist distinction. Today, with certain changes in the conditions of research due to the introduction of the concept of ?strategic research?, politicians are more apt to accept certain points of the thesis; scientific communities, on the other hand, perceive new threats to their autonomy. This paper tries to make sense of this new situation by translating the question of interplay between internal and external dynamics of research into one involving boundary management and epistemic criteria. The notion of ?epistemic drift? is introduced and the internalist/externalist distinction refurbished in neo-institutionalist terms, making use of the concept of interfoliating credibility cycles.},

In this paper, we present an exploratory investigation of science supply and societal needs on the grand challenge of obesity – an emerging health problem with enormous social costs. We illustrate a potential approach that uses topic modelling to explore: (a) how scientific publications can be used to describe existing priorities in science production; (b) how policy records (in this case here questions posed in the European parliament) can be used as an instance of mapping discourse of social needs; (c) how the comparison between the two may show (mis)alignments between societal concerns and scientific outputs. While this is a technical exercise, we propose that this type of mapping methods can be useful to domain experts for informing strategic planning and evaluation in funding agencies.},

We explore a new method for answering this question by identifying 11 articles from two open access biology journals that were shared on Twitter at least 50 times and by analyzing the follower network of users who tweeted each article. We find that diffusion patterns of scientific articles can take very different forms, even when the number of times they are tweeted is similar. Our small case study suggests that most articles are shared within single-connected communities with limited diffusion to the public. The proposed approach and indicators can serve those interested in the public understanding of science, science communication, or research evaluation to identify when research diffuses beyond insular communities.},

The method reliably identifies matches between Twitter accounts and scholarly authors. It consists of a matching of elements such as author names, usernames, handles, and URLs, followed by a rule-based scoring system that weights the common occurrence of these elements related to the activities of Twitter users and scholars. The method proceeds by matching the Twitter accounts against a database of millions of disambiguated bibliographic profiles from WoS. This paper describes the implementation and validation of the matching method, and performs verification through precision-recall analysis. We also explore the geographical, disciplinary, and demographic variations in the distribution of scholars matched to a Twitter account. This approach represents a step forward in the development of more advanced forms of social media studies of science by opening up an important door for studying the interactions between science and social media in general, and for studying the activities of scholars on Twitter in particular.},

	abstract = {In many countries the public's main source of information about science and technology is the mass media. Unfortunately, in recent years traditional journalism has experienced a collapse, and science journalism has been a major casualty. One potential remedy is to encourage scientists to write for news media about science. On these general news platforms, scientists' stories would have to compete for attention with other news stories on hard (e.g. politics) and entertaining (e.g. celebrity news) topics written by professional writers. Do they stand a chance? This study aimed to quantitatively characterize audience interactions as an indicator of interest in science news stories authored by early career scientists (henceforth ‘scientists’) trained to function as science reporters, as compared to news items written by reporters and published in the same news outlets. To measure users' behavior, we collected data on the number of clicks, likes, comments and average time spent on page. The sample was composed of 150 science items written by 50 scientists trained to contribute popular science stories in the Davidson Institute of Science Education reporters’ program and published on two major Israeli news websites—Mako and Ynet between July 2015 to January 2018. Each science item was paired with another item written by the website’s organic reporter, and published on the same channel as the science story (e.g., tourism, health) and the same close time. Overall significant differences were not found in the public's engagement with the different items. Although, on one website there was a significant difference on two out of four engagement types, the second website did not have any difference, e.g., people did not click, like or comment more on items written by organic reporters than on the stories written by scientists. This creates an optimistic starting point for filling the science news void by scientists as science reporters.},

	abstract = {‘Social media metrics’ are bursting into science studies as emerging new measures of impact related to scholarly activities. However, their meaning and scope as scholarly metrics is still far from being grasped. This research seeks to shift focus from the consideration of social media metrics around science as mere indicators confined to the analysis of the use and visibility of publications on social media to their consideration as metrics of interaction and circulation of scientific knowledge across different communities of attention, and particularly as metrics that can also be used to characterize these communities. Although recent research efforts have proposed tentative typologies of social media users, no study has empirically examined the full range of Twitter user’s behavior within Twitter and disclosed the latent dimensions in which activity on Twitter around science can be classified. To do so, we draw on the overall activity of social media users on Twitter interacting with research objects collected from the Altmetic.com database. Data from over 1.3 million unique users, accounting for over 14 million tweets to scientific publications, is analyzed. Based on an exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, four latent dimensions are identified: ‘Science Engagement’, ‘Social Media Capital’, ‘Social Media Activity’ and ‘Science Focus’. Evidence on the predominant type of users by each of the four dimensions is provided by means of VOSviewer term maps of Twitter profile descriptions. This research breaks new ground for the systematic analysis and characterization of social media users’ activity around science.},

Despite low levels of trust in social media, they are used for accessing political information and news. In this study, we examine the information verification practices of opinion leaders (who consume political information above average and share their opinions on social media above average) and of opinion seekers (who seek out political information from friends and family) to understand similarities and differences in their news media trust, fact-checking behaviors, and likeliness of being caught in echo chambers. Based on a survey of French Internet users (N = 2,000) we find that not only opinion leaders, but also opinion seekers, have higher rates across all three of these dependent variables. We discuss the implications of findings for the development of opinion leadership theory as well as for social media platforms wishing to increase trust.},

	abstract = {The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by a bulk of scientific research and related Twitter discussions. To unravel the public concerns about the COVID-19 crisis reflected in the science-based Twitter conversations, this study tracked the Twitter attention around the COVID-19 research efforts during the first three months of 2020. On the basis of nearly 1.4 million Twitter mentions of 6,162 COVID-19-related scientific publications, we investigated the temporal tweeting dynamic and the Twitter users involved in the online discussions around COVID-19-related research. The results show that the quantity of Twitter mentions of COVID-19-related publications was on rising. Scholarly-oriented Twitter users played an influential role in disseminating research outputs on COVID-19, with their tweets being frequently retweeted. Over time, a change in the focus of the Twitter discussions can be observed, from the initial attention to virological and clinical research to more practical topics, such as the potential treatments, the countermeasures by the governments, the healthcare measures, and the influences on the economy and society, in more recent times.},

	abstract = {In late March of 2020, a new hashtag, \#FilmYourHospital, made its first appearance on social media. The hashtag encouraged people to visit local hospitals to take pictures and videos of empty hospitals to help “prove” that the COVID-19 pandemic is an elaborate hoax. Using techniques from Social Network Analysis, this case study examines how this conspiracy theory propagated on Twitter and whether the hashtag virality was aided by the use of automation or coordination among Twitter users. We found that while much of the content came from users with limited reach, the oxygen that fueled this conspiracy in its early days came from a handful of prominent conservative politicians and far right political activists on Twitter. These power users used this hashtag to build awareness about the campaign and to encourage their followers to break quarantine and film what is happening at their local hospitals. After the initial boost by a few prominent accounts, the campaign was mostly sustained by pro-Trump accounts, followed by a secondary wave of propagation outside the U.S. The rise of the \#FilmYourHospital conspiracy from a single tweet demonstrates the ongoing challenge of addressing false, viral information during the COVID-19 pandemic. While the spread of misinformation can be potentially mitigated by fact-checking and directing people to credible sources of information from public health agencies, false and misleading claims that are driven by politics and supported by strong convictions and not science are much harder to root out.},

First, we should consider whether sampling only tenure-track or tenured faculty in physical, biological, and social sciences in US land-grant universities (of which 27 were excluded) gives a representative picture of scientists’ attitudes. For example, no rationale is provided for excluding scientists on more precarious nonpermanent work contracts, even though such contracts are widespread in the United States, and may come with different incentives for and attitudes toward public communication of science.

However, too little is known about scientists’ opinions of and attitudes towards the public with whom they interact during these activities, especially in southern European countries such as Spain. If we want to establish an effective dialogue between science and society, we need to be aware of the opinions and perceptions that both parties have of each other. In this study, we address this issue by focusing on 1022 responses to a survey conducted among scientists in Spain to discover their views of the public, and we then compare these responses with data from other national surveys on the public’s understanding of science. The results show that approximately 75\% of Spanish scientists think that the general public has a serious lack of knowledge and understanding of scientific reasoning, although scientists do recognize that science interests the public (73\%). Scientists believe that the public values the scientific profession to a lesser extent than suggested by public surveys: on a scale of 1–5, survey respondents rate their valuation of the scientific profession at 4.22, whereas scientists rate the public's valuation of the profession at 3.12, on average. Significant differences were detected between scientists’ perceptions of how citizens are informed about science and what citizens report in surveys. The challenge for the future is to narrow this gap in order to help scientists gain a better understanding of the public and their interests and to make public engagement activities more effective.},

The difficulty of inferring meaning from social media acts is also, and perhaps more importantly, due to the fact the even identical acts that are in appearance identical and that occur on the same platforms and contexts can have diverse meanings. This paper proposes a model based on the concepts of social and topical distance that can help shed light on the possible meanings of a social media act. The model considers the social relationship between the content creator and the user, as well as the topical relationship between the content the user's main topics of interest. It is demonstrated by analyzing a set of papers published in JASIST that were tweeted by researchers. The results show that the model can help differentiate between different types of heterogeneous social media acts and users or be used to characterize the attention that a specific content has received on social media.},

The second part reviews empirical studies of altmetrics, discussing the various interpretations of altmetrics, data collection and methodological limitations, and differences according to platform.

We focus on the climate change debate on Twitter and combine network analysis with automated content analysis. The results show that scientists interact most intensively with their peers, but also communication beyond the scientific community is important. The findings suggest that scientists adjust their communication style to their audience: They use more neutral language when communicating with other scientists, and more words expressing negative emotions when communicating with journalists, civil society, and politicians. Likewise, they stress certainty more when communicating with politicians, indicating that scientists use language strategically when communicating beyond the scientific community.},

The labels for these fields can be confusing and overlapping, and what does and does not constitute an information profession has become unclear. We have available a body of theory and analysis that can form the basis of a review of this new professional landscape, and enable us to clarify and rationalize the array of emerging information professions. Work by the author and others on the philosophical nature, and core elements, of the information professions is drawn upon and applied to the current professional scene. The nature of information itself and of information-related activities are defined and closely analysed to produce models of the disciplines and the work elements within the disciplines of information. The analysis makes possible the incorporation of popular new information disciplines into an overarching framework that also includes pre-existing fields. The analysis provides a perspective that clarifies the relationships among the information disciplines as well as their relationship to other professional activities in society.},

The survey was repeated with a selection of today's corporate librarians. Their responses are strikingly similar to those of their early twentieth-century counterparts, despite intervening technological change.

Through sensemaking, people in an organization give meaning to the events and actions of the organization. Through knowledge creation, the insights of individuals are converted into knowledge that can be used to design new products or improve performance. Finally, in decision making, understanding and knowledge are focused on the selection of and commitment to an appropriate course of action.

We conceptualize digital resignation as a rational response to consumer surveillance. We further argue that routine corporate practices encourage this sense of helplessness.

Bell?s information society thesis is best understood as a synthesis of these elements. His arguments are also evaluated. It is suggested that the information economy element is not satisfactorily supported by the evidence cited and that his emphasis on theoretical knowledge may also be excessive. As regards Bell?s account of information technology, his position shifted from a technocratic preoccupation with mainframes to an uncritical enthusiasm for the micro-computer. In spite of such shortcomings, Bell?s synthetic information society thesis is the strongest available.},

	abstract = {Purpose In The Invisible Substrate of Information Science, a landmark article about the discipline of information science, Marcia J. Bates wrote that “…we are always looking for the red thread of information in the social texture of people's lives” (1999a, p. 1048). To sharpen our understanding of information science and to elaborate Bates' idea, the work at hand answers the question: Just what does the red thread of information entail? Design/methodology/approach Through a close reading of Bates' oeuvre and by applying concepts from the reference literature of information science, nine composite entities that qualify as the red thread of information are identified, elaborated, and related to existing concepts in the information science literature. In the spirit of a scientist–poet (White, 1999), several playful metaphors related to the color red are employed. Findings Bates' red thread of information entails: terms, genres, literatures, classification systems, scholarly communication, information retrieval, information experience, information institutions, and information policy. This same constellation of phenomena can be found in resonant visions of information science, namely, domain analysis (Hjørland, 2002), ethnography of infrastructure (Star, 1999), and social epistemology (Shera, 1968). Research limitations/implications With the vital vermilion filament in clear view, newcomers can more easily engage the material, conceptual, and social machinery of information science, and specialists are reminded of what constitutes information science as a whole. Future researchers and scientist–poets may wish to supplement the nine composite entities with additional, emergent information phenomena. Originality/value Though the explication of information science that follows is relatively orthodox and time-bound, the paper offers an imaginative, accessible, yet technically precise way of understanding the field.},

The conflict between objective and subjective ways of understanding information corresponds to the conflict between an understanding of information as a thing or a substance versus an understanding of it as a sign. It is a fundamental distinction that involves a whole theory of knowledge, and it has roots back to different metaphors applied in Shannon's information theory. It is argued that a subject-dependent/situation specific understanding of information is best suited to fulfill the needs in information science and that it is urgent for us to base Information Science (IS; or Library and Information Science, LIS) on this alternative theoretical frame.},

Information as an experience good is inherently challenging to evaluate a priori; therefore, comparing value before and after different types of experience is likely to inform theory about users' preferences regarding information. Prior research mostly refers to consuming information and rarely considers the experience of producing information as a factor affecting information value. The current research compares the effect of experiencing online information through production and consumption processes on value perception. In a set of 6 experiments with 178 participants, willingness-to-pay by consumers and willingness-to-accept payment by producers are measured before and after consumption and production of information, independently and as repeated measures. In the experiments, we define and implement a framework for an information production process. The results show that the value of information is dynamic. Value perception increased after experiencing information, especially when people engaged in producing information compared to consuming it. This study offers a window toward the practical design of new digital information products.},

	abstract = {An emerging research agenda focuses on social media's influence on political activism. Specific attention has recently been paid to digital social movement organizing and action repertoire development. The literature acknowledges the changing face of activism at the movement level, but little is known about the relationship between social movement organizations (SMOs) and digital action repertoires. Understanding this relationship is critical because strong adherence to values is at the heart of establishing action repertoires with legitimacy and persistence. In this paper, we rely on a two-year longitudinal study of the Swedish affiliate of Amnesty International. We examine the transformation in engagement and interaction that followed the organization's introduction of new action repertoires. Drawing on resource mobilization theory and the collective action space model, we elaborate how new action repertoires both stabilized and challenged the values of the SMO, as well as gradually broadened the interactions of supporters and deepened their modes of engagement. We offer a value-based model on the antecedents and effects of new action repertoires from the SMO perspective. The empirical findings and the model build new theory on social media and digital activism at the organizational level, complementing the predominant movement level research in the extant literature.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to lay a theoretical foundation for identifying operational information units for library and information professional activities in the context of scholarly communication. Design/methodology/approach The study adopts a deduction-verification approach to formulate a typology of units for scholarly information. It first deduces possible units from an existing conceptualization of information, which defines information as the combined product of data and meaning, and then tests the usefulness of these units via two empirical investigations, one with a group of scholarly papers and the other with a sample of scholarly information users. Findings The results show that, on defining an information unit as a piece of information that is complete in both data and meaning, to such an extent that it remains meaningful to its target audience when retrieved and displayed independently in a database, it is then possible to formulate a hierarchical typology of units for scholarly information. The typology proposed in this study consists of three levels, which in turn, consists of 1, 5 and 44 units, respectively. Research limitations/implications The result of this study has theoretical implications on both the philosophical and conceptual levels: on the philosophical level, it hinges on, and reinforces the objective view of information; on the conceptual level, it challenges the conceptualization of work by IFLA’s Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records and Library Reference Model but endorses that by Library of Congress’s BIBFRAME 2.0 model. Practical implications It calls for reconsideration of existing operational units in a variety of library and information activities. Originality/value The study strengthens the conceptual foundation of operational information units and brings to light the primacy of “one work” as an information unit and the possibility for it to be supplemented by smaller units.},

Comment peut-il évaluer sa crédibilité, et à qui se vouer dans les cas (fréquents) où plusieurs experts divergent d'opinion? Fruit du travail de dix-neuf chercheurs, cet ouvrage collectif présente le personnage social de l'expert, les usages sociopolitiques de son travail ainsi que les manières d'arbitrer ses prétentions dans notre société. Une des grandes forces de ce livre tient à son caractère multidisciplinaire, qui accorde une place importante à la philosophie, à la science politique, à l'histoire, à la sociologie et aux sciences de la communication. Chaque texte offre un état de la question sur un volet précis et donne des clés d'explication à des problèmes actuels : contestation de la statistique publique, place des valeurs et des citoyens dans les décisions publiques, rôle social de la science, régulation des groupes professionnels ou rapports de pouvoir dans les espaces numériques. Les auteurs rendent ainsi compte des acquis de la recherche et des débats en cours, et offrent un outil de référence qui s'adresse au grand public comme aux spécialistes et aux étudiants en sciences humaines et sociales."--Site web de l'éditeur.},

This article contributes by reporting on an international survey of researchers in various disciplines and with varying levels of experience. The study examines the extent to which various journal characteristics affect journal selection, perceptions of the extent to which university and national research policies impact on their journal choice, and the influence of academics’ familiarity, confidence and objectives on journal choice. The most important factors influencing journal choice were as follows: reliability of reviewing, usefulness of reviewers’ feedback, the reputation of the journal and confidence that their article is in scope for the journal. Publishing productivity, publishing experience, researcher role and discipline had little impact on the ranking of journal choice factors, suggesting that the research community is homogeneous.},

	abstract = {Purpose In The Invisible Substrate of Information Science, a landmark article about the discipline of information science, Marcia J. Bates wrote that “…we are always looking for the red thread of information in the social texture of people's lives” (1999a, p. 1048). To sharpen our understanding of information science and to elaborate Bates' idea, the work at hand answers the question: Just what does the red thread of information entail? Design/methodology/approach Through a close reading of Bates' oeuvre and by applying concepts from the reference literature of information science, nine composite entities that qualify as the red thread of information are identified, elaborated, and related to existing concepts in the information science literature. In the spirit of a scientist–poet (White, 1999), several playful metaphors related to the color red are employed. Findings Bates' red thread of information entails: terms, genres, literatures, classification systems, scholarly communication, information retrieval, information experience, information institutions, and information policy. This same constellation of phenomena can be found in resonant visions of information science, namely, domain analysis (Hjørland, 2002), ethnography of infrastructure (Star, 1999), and social epistemology (Shera, 1968). Research limitations/implications With the vital vermilion filament in clear view, newcomers can more easily engage the material, conceptual, and social machinery of information science, and specialists are reminded of what constitutes information science as a whole. Future researchers and scientist–poets may wish to supplement the nine composite entities with additional, emergent information phenomena. Originality/value Though the explication of information science that follows is relatively orthodox and time-bound, the paper offers an imaginative, accessible, yet technically precise way of understanding the field.},

	abstract = {This session introduces a new approach to the concept of information, utilizing an arts-informed, visual approach. 137 graduate students from a North American iSchool were asked “What is information?” and responded by drawing upon a 4” by 4” piece of paper, coined an “iSquare.” The drawings of information (Figure 1) were analyzed using compositional and thematic analysis techniques adapted from precedent visual studies. The results include the identification of the most common graphical representations used to express information, as well as three themes pertaining to the social, technological, and “informational” dimensions of information. This panel employs the iSquare study and its outcomes as a springboard to engage – afresh – the concept of information today. After the original research is reported, invited experts from information science, museum studies, and social epistemology will offer commentary. “The Concept Formerly Known as Information” is a riff on the antics of American singer-songwriter Prince, who in 1993 changed his name to an unpronounceable glyph and was called (for a short time) “The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.” This panel seeks a similar jolt to the status-quo when the concept of information is transformed from word to image.},

	abstract = {Science is undergoing rapid change with the movement to improve science focused largely on reproducibility/replicability and open science practices. This moment of change—in which science turns inward to examine its methods and practices—provides an opportunity to address its historic lack of diversity and noninclusive culture. Through network modeling and semantic analysis, we provide an initial exploration of the structure, cultural frames, and women’s participation in the open science and reproducibility literatures (n = 2,926 articles and conference proceedings). Network analyses suggest that the open science and reproducibility literatures are emerging relatively independently of each other, sharing few common papers or authors. We next examine whether the literatures differentially incorporate collaborative, prosocial ideals that are known to engage members of underrepresented groups more than independent, winner-takes-all approaches. We find that open science has a more connected, collaborative structure than does reproducibility. Semantic analyses of paper abstracts reveal that these literatures have adopted different cultural frames: open science includes more explicitly communal and prosocial language than does reproducibility. Finally, consistent with literature suggesting the diversity benefits of communal and prosocial purposes, we find that women publish more frequently in high-status author positions (first or last) within open science (vs. reproducibility). Furthermore, this finding is further patterned by team size and time. Women are more represented in larger teams within reproducibility, and women’s participation is increasing in open science over time and decreasing in reproducibility. We conclude with actionable suggestions for cultivating a more prosocial and diverse culture of science.},

This paper uses a content analysis methodology of 10 North American library and information science program websites to discover how social justice education is marketed to potential students through an examination of open access course descriptions, mission statements, and core learning objectives where available. Findings indicate that social justice is embedded in library and information science programs, but there are limited opportunities for prospective students to seek out these courses due to a lack of open access course descriptions and mission statements and shortage of integration in required courses. If library and information science educators want to attract future librarians with strong social justice agendas, then the promotional materials will need to be more explicit in regards to how these programs can aid students in building a social justice mindset.},

However, how the flow of authors’ research interests – a proxy of human knowledge – evolved across time is still poorly understood. Here, we build a comprehensive map of such flows across one century, revealing fundamental periods in the raise of interest in areas of human knowledge. We identify and quantify the most attractive topics over time, when a relatively significant number of researchers moved from their original area to another one, causing what we call a “diaspora of the knowledge” towards sinks of scientific interest, and we relate these points to crucial historical and political events. Noticeably, only a few areas – like Medicine, Physics or Chemistry – mainly act as sources of the diaspora, whereas areas like Material Science, Chemical Engineering, Neuroscience, Immunology and Microbiology or Environmental Science behave like sinks.},

	abstract = {Most studies on global health inequality consider unequal health care and socio-economic conditions but neglect inequality in the production of health knowledge relevant to addressing disease burden. We demonstrate this inequality and identify likely causes. Using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for 111 prominent medical conditions, assessed globally and nationally by the World Health Organization, we linked DALYs with MEDLINE articles for each condition to assess the influence of DALY-based global disease burden, compared to the global market for treatment, on the production of relevant MEDLINE articles, systematic reviews, clinical trials and research using animal models vs. humans. We then explored how DALYs, wealth, and the production of research within countries correlate with this global pattern. We show that global DALYs for each condition had a small, significant negative relationship with the production of each type of MEDLINE articles for that condition. Local processes of health research appear to be behind this. Clinical trials and animal studies but not systematic reviews produced within countries were strongly guided by local DALYs. More and less developed countries had very different disease profiles and rich countries publish much more than poor countries. Accordingly, conditions common to developed countries garnered more clinical research than those common to less developed countries. Many of the health needs in less developed countries do not attract attention among developed country researchers who produce the vast majority of global health knowledge—including clinical trials—in response to their own local needs. This raises concern about the amount of knowledge relevant to poor populations deficient in their own research infrastructure. We recommend measures to address this critical dimension of global health inequality.},

	abstract = {What factors affect a scientist’s choice of research problem? Qualitative research in the history and sociology of science suggests that this choice is patterned by an “essential tension” between productive tradition and risky innovation. We examine this tension through Bourdieu’s field theory of science, and we explore it empirically by analyzing millions of biomedical abstracts from MEDLINE. We represent the evolving state of chemical knowledge with networks extracted from these abstracts. We then develop a typology of research strategies on these networks. Scientists can introduce novel chemicals and chemical relationships (innovation) or delve deeper into known ones (tradition). They can consolidate knowledge clusters or bridge them. The aggregate distribution of published strategies remains remarkably stable. High-risk innovation strategies are rare and reflect a growing focus on established knowledge. An innovative publication is more likely to achieve high impact than a conservative one, but the additional reward does not compensate for the risk of failing to publish. By studying prizewinners in biomedicine and chemistry, we show that occasional gambles for extraordinary impact are a compelling explanation for observed levels of risky innovation. Our analysis of the essential tension identifies institutional forces that sustain tradition and suggests policy interventions to foster innovation.},

Despite extensive investigation into various factors that influence a scientist’s choice of research topics8–21, quantitative assessments of mechanisms that give rise to macroscopic patterns characterizing research-interest evolution of individual scientists remain limited. Here we perform a large-scale analysis of publication records, and we show that changes in research interests follow a reproducible pattern characterized by an exponential distribution. We identify three fundamental features responsible for the observed exponential distribution, which arise from a subtle interplay between exploitation and exploration in research-interest evolution5,22. We developed a random-walk-based model, allowing us to accurately reproduce the empirical observations. This work uncovers and quantitatively analyses macroscopic patterns that govern changes in research interests, thereby showing that there is a high degree of regularity underlying scientific research and individual careers.},

Which projects should we abandon and which new projects should we start? Making informed choices requires knowledge about these research options. Unfortunately, to date research portfolio options have not been defined in a consistent, transparent and relevant manner. Furthermore, we don’t know how to define demand for these options. In this article, we address the issues of consistency, transparency, relevance and demand by using a model of science consisting of 91,726 topics (or research options) that contain over 58 million documents. We present a new indicator of topic prominence – a measure of visibility, momentum and, ultimately, demand. We assign over \$203 billion of project-level funding data from STAR METRICS® to individual topics in science, and show that the indicator of topic prominence, explains over one-third of the variance in current (or future) funding by topic. We also show that highly prominent topics receive far more funding per researcher than topics that are not prominent. Implications of these results for research planning and portfolio analysis by institutions and researchers are emphasized.},

	abstract = {A scientist’s choice of research problem affects his or her personal career trajectory. Scientists’ combined choices affect the direction and efficiency of scientific discovery as awhole. In this paper, we infer preferences that shape problem selection from patterns of published findings and then quantify their efficiency. We represent research problems as links between scientific entities in a knowledge network. We then build a generative model of discovery informed by qualitative research on scientific problem selection. We map salient features from this literature to key network properties: an entity’s importance corresponds to its degree centrality, and a problem’s difficulty corresponds to the network distance it spans. Drawing on millions of papers and patents published over 30 years, we use this model to infer the typical research strategy used to explore chemical relationships in biomedicine. This strategy generates conservative research choices focused on building up knowledge around important molecules. These choices become more conservative over time. The observed strategy is efficient for initial exploration of the network and supports scientific careers that require steady output, but is inefficient for science as a whole. Through supercomputer experiments on a sample of the network, we study thousands of alternatives and identify strategies much more efficient at exploring mature knowledge networks. We find that increased risk-taking and the publication of experimental failures would substantially improve the speed of discovery. We consider institutional shifts in grant making, evaluation, and publication that would help realize these efficiencies.},

We provide a general method for pursuing such knowledge, using the specific example of climate change science to illustrate how research on science policy could be organized to support improved decisions about the organization of science itself.},

We develop this concept to explore the degree of autonomy researchers in fact have in this process and draw on semi-structured interview material with research group leaders in Finland and the UK, in the former in seven research fields, in the latter in two fields. First, the analysis reveals that topic selection is strongly filtered by the intra-scientific factors. In topic selection researchers have more leeway, a broader negotiated space than in research content, that is, in the ways in which they pursue their research, which are more affected by funding opportunities and other contextual matters. Second, the ways which affect researchers’ agency include individual- and more aggregate-level acts and factors: at the individual level, researchers resort to different strategies to create a negotiated space, but at the more aggregate level field-specific factors play a role. In fields with multiple funding opportunities, which we call ‘shopping mall’ fields, researchers can have a broader negotiated space than in fields where funding is more based on ‘lottery’. In the latter, the researchers’ negotiated space is narrow and contingent on the outcome of the funders’ decisions.},

Our review shows that little is known so far about the impact of governance on knowledge content. A research agenda does not necessarily need to include additional empirical phenomena but must address the macro-micro-macro link inherent to the question in its full complexity, and systematically exploit comparative approaches in order to establish causality.

We lack the scientometric and statistical instruments to examine the development over time of the involvement of researchers in different problem areas. In this paper we present a scientometric method to map, measure, and compare the entire corpus of individual scientists. We use this method to analyse the search strategies of 43 condensed matter physicists along their academic lifecycle. We formulate six propositions that summarise our theoretical expectations and are empirically testable: (1) a scientist’s work consists of multiple finite research trails; (2) a scientist will work in several parallel research trails; (3) a scientist’s role in research trail selection changes along the lifecycle; (4) a scientist’s portfolio will converge before it diverges; (5) the rise and fall of research trails is associated with career changes; and (6) the rise and fall of research trails is associated with the potential for reputational gain. Four propositions are confirmed, the fifth is rejected, and the sixth could not be confirmed or rejected. In combination, the results of the four confirmed propositions reveal specific search strategies along the academic lifecycle. In the PhD phase scientists work in one problem area that is often unconnected to the later portfolio. The postdoctoral phase is where scientists diversify their portfolio and their social network, entering various problem areas and abandoning low-yielding ones. A professor has a much more stable portfolio, leading the work of PhDs and postdoctoral researchers. We present an agenda for future research and discuss theoretical and policy implications.},

Here, we analyze the publication records of individual scientists, aiming to quantify their topic switching dynamics and its influence. We find that the co-citing network of papers of a scientist exhibits a clear community structure where each major community represents a research topic. Our analysis suggests that scientists have a narrow distribution of number of topics. However, researchers nowadays switch more frequently between topics than those in the early days. We also find that high switching probability in early career is associated with low overall productivity, yet with high overall productivity in latter career. Interestingly, the average citation per paper, however, is in all career stages negatively correlated with the switching probability. We propose a model that can explain the main observed features.},

	abstract = {In the book The Essential Tension (1979) Thomas Kuhn described the conflict between tradition and innovation in scientific research—i.e., the desire to explore new promising areas, counterposed to the need to capitalize on the work done in the past. While it is probable that along their careers many scientists felt this tension, only few works have tried to quantify it. Here, we address this question by analyzing a large-scale dataset, containing all the papers published by the American Physical Society (APS) in 26 years, which allows for a better understanding of scientists’ careers evolution in Physics. We employ the Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme (PACS) present in each paper to map the scientific interests of 103,246 authors and their evolution along the years. Our results indeed confirm the existence of the “essential tension” with scientists balancing between exploring the boundaries of their area and exploiting previous work. In particular, we found that although the majority of physicists change the topics of their research, they stay within the same broader area thus exploring with caution new scientific endeavors. Furthermore, we quantify the flows of authors moving between different subfields and pinpoint which areas are more likely to attract or donate researchers to the other ones. Overall, our results depict a very distinctive portrait of the evolution of research interests in Physics and can help in designing specific policies for the future.},

Individuals are likely to be anticipated if they publish much and have their publications cited often, and they are likely to be concerned about being anticipated if they are young and if they have been anticipated previously. Being in competitive situations induces scientists to shift specialties and to be secretive about their research, although those working with collaborators are less secretive. Correlates of competitiveness are presented for both 1,718 individuals and thirty-five scientific specialties as units of analysis.

The second part reviews empirical studies of altmetrics, discussing the various interpretations of altmetrics, data collection and methodological limitations, and differences according to platform. The review ends with a critical discussion of the implications of this transformation in the scholarly communication system.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze the tweeting behavior of 37 astrophysicists on Twitter and compares their tweeting behavior with their publication behavior and citation impact to show whether they tweet research-related topics or not. Design/methodology/approach Astrophysicists on Twitter are selected to compare their tweets with their publications from Web of Science. Different user groups are identified based on tweeting and publication frequency. Findings A moderate negative correlation (ρ=−0.339) is found between the number of publications and tweets per day, while retweet and citation rates do not correlate. The similarity between tweets and abstracts is very low (cos=0.081). User groups show different tweeting behavior such as retweeting and including hashtags, usernames and URLs. Research limitations/implications The study is limited in terms of the small set of astrophysicists. Results are not necessarily representative of the entire astrophysicist community on Twitter and they most certainly do not apply to scientists in general. Future research should apply the methods to a larger set of researchers and other scientific disciplines. Practical implications To a certain extent, this study helps to understand how researchers use Twitter. The results hint at the fact that impact on Twitter can neither be equated with nor replace traditional research impact metrics. However, tweets and other so-called altmetrics might be able to reflect other impact of scientists such as public outreach and science communication. Originality/value To the best of the knowledge, this is the first in-depth study comparing researchers’ tweeting activity and behavior with scientific publication output in terms of quantity, content and impact.},

	abstract = {‘Social media metrics’ are bursting into science studies as emerging new measures of impact related to scholarly activities. However, their meaning and scope as scholarly metrics is still far from being grasped. This research seeks to shift focus from the consideration of social media metrics around science as mere indicators confined to the analysis of the use and visibility of publications on social media to their consideration as metrics of interaction and circulation of scientific knowledge across different communities of attention, and particularly as metrics that can also be used to characterize these communities. Although recent research efforts have proposed tentative typologies of social media users, no study has empirically examined the full range of Twitter user’s behavior within Twitter and disclosed the latent dimensions in which activity on Twitter around science can be classified. To do so, we draw on the overall activity of social media users on Twitter interacting with research objects collected from the Altmetic.com database. Data from over 1.3 million unique users, accounting for over 14 million tweets to scientific publications, is analyzed. Based on an exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, four latent dimensions are identified: ‘Science Engagement’, ‘Social Media Capital’, ‘Social Media Activity’ and ‘Science Focus’. Evidence on the predominant type of users by each of the four dimensions is provided by means of VOSviewer term maps of Twitter profile descriptions. This research breaks new ground for the systematic analysis and characterization of social media users’ activity around science.},

We found that astrophysicists communicate with a variety of user types (e.g. colleagues, science communicators, other researchers, and educators) and that in the ego networks of the astrophysicists clear groups consisting of users with different professional roles can be distinguished. Interestingly, the analysis of noun phrases and hashtags showed that when the astrophysicists address the different groups of very different professional composition they use very similar terminology, but that they do not talk to each other (i.e. mentioning other user names in tweets). The results also showed that in those areas of the ego networks that tweeted more the sentiment of the tweets tended to be closer to neutral, connecting frequent tweeting with information sharing activities rather than conversations or expressing opinions.},

	abstract = {Social media are computer-mediated technologies that facilitate the exchange of research outcomes and make them available to larger audiences and networks. As a result, researchers are gradually integrating these tools into their everyday workflow. This phenomenon has contributed to the development of alternative impact indicators or altmetrics. Most of the research in the area of altmetrics was focused on describing the relationship between social media indicators and bibliometric indicators. In 2016, Henk Moed argued that web-based indicators “do not have function merely in the evaluation of research performance of individuals and groups, but also in the research process”. This statement motivates us to go beyond the evaluative perspective of altmetrics to a more contextualized perspective in which the study of the citing, publishing, and tweeting activities of researchers on Web of Science is compared. Results show that, at the individual researcher level, Twitter-based indicators are empirically different from production-based and citation-based bibliometric indicators. The results of this chapter should be seen as a first step towards a conceptual shift from a mere study of the reception of publications on Twitter to a more dynamic perspective that focuses on the social media activities of researchers as part of their computerization of the scientific process. Future research directions based on the findings presented in this study are also suggested.},

Classification usually takes place at the level of journals, where the Web of Science subject categories are the most popular classification system. However, journal-level classification systems have two important limitations: They offer only a limited amount of detail, and they have difficulties with multidisciplinary journals. To avoid these limitations, we introduce a new methodology for constructing classification systems at the level of individual publications. In the proposed methodology, publications are clustered into research areas based on citation relations. The methodology is able to deal with very large numbers of publications. We present an application in which a classification system is produced that includes almost 10 million publications. Based on an extensive analysis of this classification system, we discuss the strengths and the limitations of the proposed methodology. Important strengths are the transparency and relative simplicity of the methodology and its fairly modest computing and memory requirements. The main limitation of the methodology is its exclusive reliance on direct citation relations between publications. The accuracy of the methodology can probably be increased by also taking into account other types of relations–for instance, based on bibliographic coupling.},

	abstract = {Research funding is an important factor for public science. Funding can affect which research topics get addressed, and what research outputs are produced. However, funding has often been studied simplistically, using top-down or system-led perspectives. These can restrict analysis to national funding landscapes or single funding organisations and instruments in isolation. This overlooks interlinkages and potentially broader funding that researchers might access. We instead frame an alternative ‘bottom-up’ approach, using individual researchers as the entry point. For two test research fields (food science, renewable energy research) we analyse articles published 2009–18 as an example funded research activity. Here we trace researcher funding via article funding acknowledgements (FAs) of researchers affiliated to Denmark, the Netherlands or Norway. We then map field-level ‘co-funding networks’. These turn out to include heterogeneous funding from inside, outside and across these test countries. We further study article-level ‘funding amalgamations’ – the sum of all authors’ reported funding per article. These similarly show highly varied (co-)funding by funder ‘type’ (public, private, university or non-profit) and ‘origin’ (domestic, foreign or supranational). We note this approach has certain limitations but suggest it does advance our understanding of research funding dynamics. It provides an additional perspective, and appears adaptable to further analyses (e.g. of potential influences of co-funding). We lastly suggest several implications for science policy stemming from this bottom-up approach.},

	abstract = {In many countries research evaluations confer high importance to mainstream journals, which are considered to publish excellent research. Accordingly, research evaluation policies discourage publications in other non-mainstream journals under the assumption that they publish low quality research. This approach has prompted a policy debate in low and middle-income countries, which face financial and linguistic barriers to access mainstream journals. A common criticism of the current evaluation practices is that they can hinder the development of certain topics that are not published in mainstream journals although some of them might be of high local relevance. In this article, we examine this issue by exploring the functions of non-mainstream journals in scientific communication. We interviewed researchers from agricultural sciences, business and management, and chemistry in Colombia on their reasons to publish in non-mainstream journals. We found that non-mainstream journals serve the following functions: 1) offer a space for initiation into publishing (training); 2) provide a link between articles in mainstream journals and articles read by communities with limited access to them (knowledge-bridging); 3) publish topics that are not well covered by mainstream journals (knowledge gap-filling). Therefore, publication in non-mainstream journals cannot be attributed only to ‘low scientific quality’ research. They also fulfil specific communication functions. These results suggest that research evaluation policy in low and middle-income countries should consider assigning greater value to non-mainstream journals given their role in bridging and disseminating potentially useful and novel knowledge.},

	abstract = {This study examines the reasons why authors publish in ‘predatory’ OA journals. In total, 50 journals were randomly selected from Beall's list of ‘predatory’ journals. Different methods, including WHOIS tracking, were utilized to query basic information about the selected journals, including location and registrant. Then, 300 articles were randomly selected from within selected journals in various scientific fields. Authors of the selected articles were contacted and sent survey questions to complete. A grounded theory qualitative methods approach was used for data collection and analysis. The results demonstrated that most of these journals were located in the developing world, usually Asia or Africa, even when they claimed they were in the USA or UK. Furthermore, four themes emerged after authors’ survey responses were coded, categorized, and sub-categorized. The themes were: social identity threat, unawareness, high pressure, and lack of research proficiency. Scholars in the developing world felt that reputable Western journals might be prejudiced against them and sometimes felt more comfortable publishing in journals from the developing world. Other scholars were unaware of the reputation of the journals in which they published and would not have selected them had they known. However, some scholars said they would still have published in the same journals if their institution recognised them. The pressure to ‘publish or perish’ was another factor influencing many scholars’ decisions to publish in these fast-turnaround journals. In some cases, researchers did not have adequate guidance and felt they lacked the knowledge of research to submit to a more reputable journal. More needs to be done by institutions and reputable journals to make researchers aware of the problem of ‘predatory’ journals.},

A major objective was to determine whether ECRs are taking the myriad opportunities proffered by new digital innovations, developing within the context of open science, open access, and social media, to publish their research. The main finding is that these opportunities are generally not taken because ECRs are constrained by convention and the precarious employment environment they inhabit and know what is best for them, which is to publish (in high impact factor journals) or perish.},

We found a statistically significant correlation between changes in IF, ISI percentage ranking, and changes in submissions numbers in subsequent years. We also found a statistically significant effect on submission numbers in the year following the publication of a retraction. Our case studies identified other factors, including negative feedback on the peer review process. Our findings regarding IF confirm previous indications about the significance of IF on submissions. We explain the correlation with retractions through the concept of ‘peer review reputation’.

Publication fees or article-processing charges (APC)s have become the predominant means for funding professional OA publishing. We surveyed 1,038 authors who recently published articles in 74 OA journals that charge APCs stratified into seven discipline categories. Authors were asked about the source of funding for the APC, factors influencing their choice of a journal and past history publishing in OA and subscription journals. Additional information about the journal and the authors' country were obtained from the journal website. A total of 429 (41\%) authors from 69 journals completed the survey. There were large differences in the source of funding among disciplines. Journals with impact factors charged higher APCs as did journals from disciplines where grant funding is plentiful. Fit, quality, and speed of publication were the most important factors in the authors' choice of a journal. OA was less important but a significant factor for many authors in their choice of a journal to publish. These findings are consistent with other research on OA publishing and suggest that OA publishing funded through APCs is likely to continue to grow.},

	abstract = {Purpose – This paper aims to make a substantial contribution to the ongoing debate about the potential of open access publishing and institutional repositories to reform the scholarly communication system. It presents the views of senior authors on these issues and contextualises them within the broader framework of their journal publishing behaviour and preferences. Design/methodology/approach – A highly representative online opinion survey of more than five and half thousand journals authors, building on an earlier (January 2004) benchmarking study carried out by CIBER. Findings – Senior researchers are rapidly becoming more informed about open access publishing and institutional repositories but are still a long way off reaching a consensus on the likelihood that these new models will challenge the existing order, nor are they in agreement whether this would be a positive or a negative development. Disciplinary culture and, to a less extent, regional location are key determinants of author attitudes and any policy response should avoid “one‐size‐fits‐all” solutions. Research limitations/implications – This survey reflects the opinions of senior corresponding authors who have recently published in a “top” (i.e. ISI‐indexed journal) with 95 per cent confidence. The findings should not be generalised to represent the views of all authors in all journals, open access or otherwise. Originality/value – The journal publishing sector is facing enormous challenges and opportunities as content increasingly migrates to the web. The value of this research is that it provides an objective, non‐partisan, assessment of the attitudes and opinions of more than 5,000 senior researchers, a key stakeholder group, and thus contributes both to the development of public policy as well as more realistic commercial strategies.},

Based on first-hand data collected empirically through interviews and documents, it shows that HSS English-language journals in China attempt to challenge yet are conditioned at the same time by the imbalanced international knowledge structure. While still at a preliminary stage of development in terms of quantity and quality, the journals have already been confronted with major challenges including English language hurdles, unfavorable position in research evaluation systems, unfamiliarity with standards of international academic writing and publishing, and tensions between international ambition and local commitment. This article argues that HSS journals in non-Western societies including China need to strike a balance between their contemporary bid for international visibility and long-term contribution to multiple perspectives in global HSS research.},

Therefore, appropriate cross-disciplinary studies are required to understand the exact concerns that dominate a particular field. The current study compares 16 factors that influence journal choices between medicine and social sciences using the answers given to a global survey of 235 open access journal authors. The results reveal that authors of both areas consider ‘peer reviewed’ status as the most important factor while showing the least interest to the ‘number of annual subscribers’ of the journal. However, compared to social science authors, those in the discipline of medicine give significantly more consideration to (1) impact factor, (2) the inclusion of the journal in abstracting and indexing services, (3) publisher's prestige, and (4) online submission with tracking facility. The factors that were identified can be categorized for both disciplines as reflecting the reputation of a journal, performance or production issues, and reliability and demand characteristics of their publication choice. The editors and publishers can use these findings to attract the best manuscripts as the study reveals the author's perception of the journal's status. The results can also be used to design recommender systems for journal submission for new authors in a discipline.},

	abstract = {Background
In an attempt to identify motivating factors involved in decisions to publish in open access and open archives (OA) journals, individual interviews with biomedical faculty members at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-Chapel Hill) and Duke University, two major research universities, were conducted. The interviews focused on faculty identified as early adopters of OA/free full-text publishing.

Methods
Searches conducted in PubMed and PubMed Central identified faculty from the two institutions who have published works in OA/free full-text journals. The searches targeted authors with multiple OA citations during a specified 18 month period. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the most prolific OA authors at each university. Individual interviews attempted to determine whether the authors were aware they published in OA journals, why they chose to publish in OA journals, what factors influenced their publishing decisions, and their general attitude towards OA publishing models.

Results \& Discussion
Fourteen interviews were granted and completed. Respondents included a fairly even mix of Assistant, Associate and Full professors. Results indicate that when targeting biomedical faculty at UNC-Chapel Hill and Duke, speed of publication and copyright retention are unlikely motivating factors or incentives for the promotion of OA publishing. In addition, author fees required by some open access journals are unlikely barriers or disincentives.

Conclusion
It appears that publication quality is of utmost importance when choosing publication venues in general, while free access and visibility are specifically noted incentives for selection of OA journals. Therefore, free public availability and increased exposure may not be strong enough incentives for authors to choose open access over more traditional and respected subscription based publications, unless the quality issue is also addressed.},

However, in one line of interpretation it could be argued that the Triple Helix places the emphasis on knowledge production and innovation in the economy so it is compatible with the knowledge economy. The Quadruple Helix already encourages the perspective of the knowledge society, and of knowledge democracy for knowledge production and innovation. In a Quadruple Helix understanding, the sustainable development of a knowledge economy requires a coevolution with the knowledge society. The Quintuple Helix stresses the necessary socioecological transition of society and economy in the twenty-first century; therefore, the Quintuple Helix is ecologically sensitive. Within the framework of the Quintuple Helix innovation model, the natural environments of society and the economy also should be seen as drivers for knowledge production and innovation, therefore defining opportunities for the knowledge economy. The European Commission in 2009 identified the socioecological transition as a major challenge for the future roadmap of development. The Quintuple Helix supports here the formation of a win-win situation between ecology, knowledge and innovation, creating synergies between economy, society, and democracy. Global warming represents an area of ecological concern, to which the Quintuple Helix innovation model can be applied with greater potential.},

Today, the simple counting of publications has been supplemented with a whole range of bibliometric indicators, which supposedly not only measures the volume of research but also its impact. In this study, we investigate how bibliometrics are used for evaluating the impact and quality of publications in two specific settings: biomedicine and economics. Our study exposes the various metrics used in external evaluations of candidates for academic positions at Swedish universities. Moreover, we show how different bibliometric indicators, both explicitly and implicitly, are employed to assess and rank candidates. Our findings contribute to a further understanding of bibliometric indicators as 'judgment devices' that are employed in evaluating individuals and their published works within specific fields. We also show how 'expertise' in using bibliometrics for evaluative purposes is negotiated at the interface between domain knowledge and skills in using indicators. In line with these results, we propose that the use of metrics we report is best described as a form of 'citizen bibliometrics'- an underspecified term which we build upon in the article.},

We consider the attributes, novelty, and disruptive potential of different models, which range from improvements to the extant model to attempts at reconfiguration and transformation. We propose that journal transition can be seen as falling into three categories. The first is enhanced models of the traditional scholarly journal, which typically afford enriched functionality that breaks the bonds of the printed page whilst otherwise remaining wholly traditional in their offerings. The second category is innovative models of the traditional scholarly journal, which aim at supporting the journal in performing its traditional roles through convention-altering ways. The third category is the possible alternatives to the traditional journal, which represent a move towards alternative modes of knowledge dissemination. This review shows that each of the models identified makes contributions to enriching the reporting and showcasing of scholarly output. They also make it more effective and more efficient. However, we conclude that none of the possible alternatives being discussed can serve as a full-fledged alternative to the journal.},

Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic scientific evidence that altmetrics are valid proxies of either impact or utility although a few case studies have reported medium correlations between specific altmetrics and citation rates for individual journals or fields. To fill this gap, this study compares 11 altmetrics with Web of Science citations for 76 to 208,739 PubMed articles with at least one altmetric mention in each case and up to 1,891 journals per metric. It also introduces a simple sign test to overcome biases caused by different citation and usage windows. Statistically significant associations were found between higher metric scores and higher citations for articles with positive altmetric scores in all cases with sufficient evidence (Twitter, Facebook wall posts, research highlights, blogs, mainstream media and forums) except perhaps for Google+ posts. Evidence was insufficient for LinkedIn, Pinterest, question and answer sites, and Reddit, and no conclusions should be drawn about articles with zero altmetric scores or the strength of any correlation between altmetrics and citations. Nevertheless, comparisons between citations and metric values for articles published at different times, even within the same year, can remove or reverse this association and so publishers and scientometricians should consider the effect of time when using altmetrics to rank articles. Finally, the coverage of all the altmetrics except for Twitter seems to be low and so it is not clear if they are prevalent enough to be useful in practice.},

For 9.2 million interdisciplinary research papers published between 2000 and 2012 we show that the majority (69.9\%) of co-cited interdisciplinary pairs are "win-win" relationships, i.e., papers that cite them have higher citation impact and there are as few as 3.3\% "lose-lose" relationships. Papers citing references from subdisciplines positioned far apart (in the conceptual space of the UCSD map of science) attract the highest relative citation counts. The findings support the assumption that interdisciplinary research is more successful and leads to results greater than the sum of its disciplinary parts.},

	abstract = {A number of new metrics based on social media platforms-grouped under the term "altmetrics" - have recently been introduced as potential indicators of research impact. Despite their current popularity, there is a lack of information regarding the determinants of these metrics. Using publication and citation data from 1.3 million papers published in 2012 and covered in Thomson Reuters' Web of Science as well as social media counts from Altmetric. com, this paper analyses the main patterns of five social media metrics as a function of document characteristics (i.e., discipline, document type, title length, number of pages and references) and collaborative practices and compares them to patterns known for citations. Results show that the presence of papers on social media is low, with 21.5\% of papers receiving at least one tweet, 4.7\% being shared on Facebook, 1.9\% mentioned on blogs, 0.8\% found on Google+ and 0.7\% discussed in mainstream media. By contrast, 66.8\% of papers have received at least one citation. Our findings show that both citations and social media metrics increase with the extent of collaboration and the length of the references list. On the other hand, while editorials and news items are seldom cited, it is these types of document that are the most popular on Twitter. Similarly, while longer papers typically attract more citations, an opposite trend is seen on social media platforms. Finally, contrary to what is observed for citations, it is papers in the Social Sciences and humanities that are the most often found on social media platforms. On the whole, these findings suggest that factors driving social media and citations are different. Therefore, social media metrics cannot actually be seen as alternatives to citations; at most, they may function as complements to other type of indicators.},

Design/methodology/approach - Astrophysicists on Twitter are selected to compare their tweets with their publications from Web of Science. Different user groups are identified based on tweeting and publication frequency. Findings - A moderate negative correlation (rho- -0.339) is found between the number of publications and tweets per day, while retweet and citation rates do not correlate. The similarity between tweets and abstracts is very low (cos=0.081). User groups show different tweeting behavior such as retweeting and including hashtags, usernames and URLs. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited in terms of the small set of astrophysicists. Results are not necessarily representative of the entire astrophysicist community on Twitter and they most certainly do not apply to scientists in general. Future research should apply the methods to a larger set of researchers and other scientific disciplines. Practical implications - To a certain extent, this study helps to understand how researchers use Twitter. The results hint at the fact that impact on Twitter can neither be equated with nor replace traditional research impact metrics. However, tweets and other so-called altmetrics might be able to reflect other impact of scientists such as public outreach and science communication. Originality/value - To the best of the knowledge, this is the first in-depth study comparing researchers' tweeting activity and behavior with scientific publication output in terms of quantity, content and impact.},

The admitted members are classified in a ranking system in one of the four categories: SNI III (seniors), SNI II (established), SNI I (early-stage), and candidates (young researchers). The SNI appointment provides the recognition of national investigator that constitutes the most prestigious reward among researchers in the country. The distribution of the 2977 active members in 2013 in the area of social sciences shows a greater concentration of seniors and established researchers within the federal public higher education institutions, while early-stage and young researchers were mostly affiliated with states public universities. Our analysis focuses on general characteristics of SNI members: affiliations, gender, country of graduation, and scientific output. Also, we identify their career pathway through revocation, promotion and retention rates for each category: SNI III, SNI II, SNI I, and Candidates.},

Yet, empirical studies in the area are rare and plagued with several limitations. As a result, we lack clear evidence on the relationship between aging and scholarly communication activities and impact. To this end, we study the complete publication profiles of more than 1000 authors across three fields-sociology, economics, and political science-to understand the relationship between aging, productivity, collaboration, and impact. Furthermore, we analyze multiple operationalizations of aging, to determine which is more closely related to observable changes in scholarly communication behavior. The study demonstrates that scholars remain highly productive across the life-span of the career (i.e., 40 years), and that productivity increases steeply until promotion to associate professor and then remains stable. Collaboration increases with age and has increased over time. Lastly, a scholar's work obtains its highest impact directly around promotion and then decreases over time. Finally, our results suggest a statistically significant relationship between rank of the scholar and productivity, collaboration, and impact. These results inform our understanding of the scientific workforce and the production of science.},

Results show that arXiv and WoS share similar topics in a given domain, but differ in evolution trends.

This study examined labor roles by gender using contributorship data from science and medical journals published by the Public Library of Science (PLOS), which require each author to indicate their contribution to one or more of the following tasks: (1) analyzed the data, (2) conceived and designed the experiments, (3) contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools, (4) performed the experiments, and (5) wrote the paper. Method The authors analyzed contribution data from more than 85,000 articles published between 2008 and 2013 in PLOS journals with respect to gender using both descriptive and regression analyses. Results Gender was a significant variable in determining the likelihood of performing a certain task associated with authorship. Women were significantly more likely to be associated with performing experiments, and men were more likely to be associated with all other authorship roles. This holds true controlling for academic age: Although experimentation was associated with academically younger scholars, the gap between male and female contribution to this task remained constant across academic age. Inequalities were observed in the distribution of scientific labor roles. Conclusions These disparities have implications for the production of scholarly knowledge, the evaluation of scholars, and the ethical conduct of science. Adopting the practice of identifying contributorship rather than authorship in scientific journals will allow for greater transparency, accountability, and equitable allocation of resources.},

The analysis is based on 1.4 million documents covered by both PubMed and Web of Science and published between 2010 and 2012. The number of tweets containing links to these documents was analyzed and compared to citations to evaluate the degree to which certain journals, disciplines, and specialties were represented on Twitter and how far tweets correlate with citation impact. With less than 10\% of PubMed articles mentioned on Twitter, its uptake is low in general but differs between journals and specialties. Correlations between tweets and citations are low, implying that impact metrics based on tweets are different from those based on citations.

Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic scientific evidence that altmetrics are valid proxies of either impact or utility although a few case studies have reported medium correlations between specific altmetrics and citation rates for individual journals or fields. To fill this gap, this study compares 11 altmetrics with Web of Science citations for 76 to 208,739 PubMed articles with at least one altmetric mention in each case and up to 1,891 journals per metric. It also introduces a simple sign test to overcome biases caused by different citation and usage windows. Statistically significant associations were found between higher metric scores and higher citations for articles with positive altmetric scores in all cases with sufficient evidence (Twitter, Facebook wall posts, research highlights, blogs, mainstream media and forums) except perhaps for Google+ posts. Evidence was insufficient for LinkedIn, Pinterest, question and answer sites, and Reddit, and no conclusions should be drawn about articles with zero altmetric scores or the strength of any correlation between altmetrics and citations. Nevertheless, comparisons between citations and metric values for articles published at different times, even within the same year, can remove or reverse this association and so publishers and scientometricians should consider the effect of time when using altmetrics to rank articles. Finally, the coverage of all the altmetrics except for Twitter seems to be low and so it is not clear if they are prevalent enough to be useful in practice.},

This new indicator is based on bibliographic coupling and counts the percentage of re-citations given in subsequent years. Method. The applicability of the new indicator is demonstrated on a selection of general science journals and on a selection of medical journals. The reference lists of each journal are compared year by year, and the percentage of re-citations is calculated by dividing the number of re-citations with the total number of citations each year. Analysis. To validate re-citations as caused by specialisation, other possible causes were measured and correlated (obsolescence, journal self-citations and number of references). Results. The results indicate that the focus factor is capable of distinguishing between general and specialised journals and thus effectively measures the intended phenomenon (i.e., journal specialisation). Only weak correlations were found between journal re-citations and obsolescence, journal self-citations, and number of references. Conclusions. The focus factor successfully measures journal specialisation over time. Measures based on either simple citation analysis or bibliographic coupling are found to be close relatives. Measures based on journal self-citation are found to be only weakly correlated with the focus factor. Measures based on co-citation analysis remain to be studied and compared.},

Here, I present a Q-method study that explores ecologists' thought processes as they evaluate the merits of potential research topics.

This study uncovers four competing visions that ecologists have for their discipline. On the basis of these findings, I contend that ecology might be more effective in informing policy if priority setting were a more deliberative process and open to insights from individuals and institutions outside of ecology.},

We lack the scientometric and statistical instruments to examine the development over time of the involvement of researchers in different problem areas. In this paper we present a scientometric method to map, measure, and compare the entire corpus of individual scientists. We use this method to analyse the search strategies of 43 condensed matter physicists along their academic lifecycle. We formulate six propositions that summarise our theoretical expectations and are empirically testable: (1) a scientist's work consists of multiple finite research trails; (2) a scientist will work in several parallel research trails; (3) a scientist's role in research trail selection changes along the lifecycle; (4) a scientist's portfolio will converge before it diverges; (5) the rise and fall of research trails is associated with career changes; and (6) the rise and fall of research trails is associated with the potential for reputational gain. Four propositions are confirmed, the fifth is rejected, and the sixth could not be confirmed or rejected. In combination, the results of the four confirmed propositions reveal specific search strategies along the academic lifecycle. In the PhD phase scientists work in one problem area that is often unconnected to the later portfolio. The postdoctoral phase is where scientists diversify their portfolio and their social network, entering various problem areas and abandoning low-yielding ones. A professor has a much more stable portfolio, leading the work of PhDs and postdoctoral researchers. We present an agenda for future research and discuss theoretical and policy implications.},

Due to the difficulty of measuring them directly, S\&T policy scholars have traditionally equated "outcomes" with several proxies for evaluation, including economic impact, and academic output such as papers published and citations received. More recently, scholars have evaluated science policies through the lens of Public Value Mapping, which assesses scientific programs against societal values. Missing from these approaches is an examination of the social activities within the scientific enterprise that affect research outputs and outcomes. We contend that activities that significantly affect research trajectories take place at the levels of individual researchers and their communities, and that S\&T policy scholars must take heed of this activity in their work in order to better inform policy. Based on primary research of two scientific communities-ecologists and sustainability scientists-we demonstrate that research agendas are actively shaped by parochial epistemic and normative concerns of the scientists and their disciplines. S\&T policy scholarship that explores how scientists balance these concerns, alongside more formal science policies and incentive structures, will enhance understanding of why certain science policies fail or succeed and how to more effectively link science to beneficial social outcomes.},

	abstract = {Studies of how scientists select research problems suggest the process involves weighing a number of factors, including funding availability, likelihood of success versus failure, and perceived publishability of likely results, among others. In some fields, a strong personal interest in conducting science to bring about particular social and environmental outcomes plays an important role. Conservation biologists are frequently motivated by a desire that their research will contribute to improved conservation outcomes, which introduces a pair of challenging questions for managers of science and scholars of policies governing science: 1) How do scientists integrate that goal into their processes of research priority evaluation, and 2) How can managers and funders of science utilize that knowledge in designing and administering funding programs? I use Q method to uncover four distinct schools of thought amongst researchers and knowledge-users about the merits of possible research priorities for coral reefs; one of the axes along which these schools of thought differ is in their interpretation of how science can and should interact with policy. The results reveal that perceived severity of reef stressors plays a role for some participants. Disciplinary training does not appear to be a major influence on research priority evaluation, but individual participants indicated professional expediency does prevent some researchers from pursuing or advocating that others pursue topics outside of that disciplinary specialty. Influences on and processes in research prioritization uncovered in this study have the potential to lead to counter-productive disciplinary path dependencies. From these results and building on outside literature, I conclude that better coordination and communication about research priorities across disciplines and with broader stakeholders - including knowledge users - could improve the research enterprise's ability to contribute to meaningful societal and conservation goals. These findings are relevant to researchers and research administrators across disciplines that seek to conduct or fund science that is useful in addressing specific goals.},

As the barriers to interdisciplinary research are formidable, promoting interdisciplinary environmental research requires understanding what motivates researchers to embark upon such challenging research. This article draws upon research on problem choice and interdisciplinary research practice to investigate motivators and barriers to interdisciplinary climate change (IDCC) research. Results from a survey on the motivations of 526 Ph.D.-holding, early- to mid-career, self-identified IDCC scholars indicate how those scholars make decisions regarding their research choices including the role of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations and the barriers arising from the nature of interdisciplinary research and institutional structures. Climate change was not the main motivation for most respondents to become scholars, yet the majority began to study the issue because they could not ignore the problem. Respondents' decisions to conduct IDCC research are driven by personal motivations, including personal interest, the importance of IDCC research to society, and enjoyment of interdisciplinary collaborations. Two thirds of respondents reported having encountered challenges in communication across disciplines, longer timelines while conducting interdisciplinary work, and a lack of peer support. Nonetheless, most respondents plan to conduct IDCC research in the future and will choose their next research project based on its societal benefits and the opportunity to work with specific collaborators. We conclude that focused attention to supporting intrinsic motivations, as well as removing institutional barriers, can facilitate future IDCC research.},

One lab focuses on garnering funding through commercialization schemes, while the other is oriented to federal science agencies. The ethnographic comparison identifies the mechanisms through which an industry-oriented lab can be highly adventurous yet produce a research program that is thin and erratic due to a priority placed on commercialization. However, the comparison does not yield an implicit nostalgia for federalized science; it reveals the mechanisms through which agency-oriented labs can pursue a thick and consistent research portfolio but in a strikingly myopic fashion.},

In this paper, we analyze bibliometric data from Scopus and present results for the relationship between publication strategies, publishing productivity and citation-based publication impact for 227 full professors of chemistry and 148 professors of mechanical engineering at ten research-intensive universities in the United States. The results indicate some evidence for the "productivity as the enemy of impact" hypothesis in chemistry, where publishing at the higher margin of productivity leads to a stagnant or declining publication impact. Findings differ for mechanical engineering, where higher publishing productivity consistently leads to higher publication impact. We attribute the differences in findings between the disciplines to a higher propensity for productivity-focused publication strategies in chemistry than in mechanical engineering.},

	abstract = {The relationship between Canadian cultural institutions (art galleries, museums, funding agencies, Collections, etc.) and Indigenous peoples has always been a contentious one. The theft of Indigenous bodies and objects by these institutions is an ongoing feature of colonialism in Canada and even as Indigenous art broke into mainstream Canadian consciousness, the relationship was beset by tokenism and inequality. It was only during a period of activism that culminated in 2017, did these institutions begin to express a commitment to reconciliation. And initially, the results of the “reconciliation year” were positive with increased representation and support. However, since then and in the midst of a pandemic, those commitments have begun to evaporate. This Special Report considers themes in the historic relationship between Indigenous people in the Institutions of Canadian art and culture to
contextual a series of interviews conducted with cultural workers during
the COVID-19 pandemic, and which reveal a renewed exploitation of
their labour and their works. Finally, the Report offers 15 Standards of
Achievement that can serve as a guide for institutions and governments to begin reversing this exploitation and renewing the relationship.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this article is to introduce a theoretical framework and approach for studying the evaluation and decision-making practices through which academic librarians attempt to reduce the cost of electronic journal subscriptions – an organizational practice known as the unbundling of big deal journal packages. Design/methodology/approach The article presents a literature-based conceptual analysis of several fields to delineate the elements of the practice of unbundling of big deal journal packages. Beyond analysing the prior literature, the discussion is supported by empirical findings from a pilot study on the topic conducted by two of the article's authors. Findings The main finding of the article is that the unbundling of big deal packages is a case of what sociologist refers to as decision-making in a social context. By reviewing previous studies, the article identifies the social and material elements constitutive of this practice. This, in turn, allows to develop questions and concepts for future research on the topic and to position it as an area of inquiry within the field of information behaviour/practices. Originality/value The article is the first attempt to conceptualize the unbundling of big deal journal packages by highlighting its phenomenological status as a type of information practice. In addition, the article proposes a research approach for studying this type of information practice by drawing on insights from the information behaviour/practice literature and enriching them through practice theory contributions in organizational studies and sociology.},

	abstract = {Objective To compare the risk of cardiovascular events between sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors among people with type 2 diabetes in a real world context of clinical practice.
Design Multi-database retrospective cohort study using a prevalent new user design with subsequent meta-analysis.
Setting Canadian Network for Observational Drug Effect Studies (CNODES), with administrative healthcare databases from seven Canadian provinces and the United Kingdom, 2013-18.
Population 209 867 new users of a SGLT2 inhibitor matched to 209 867 users of a DPP-4 inhibitor on time conditional propensity score and followed for a mean of 0.9 years.
Main outcome measures The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, a composite of myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, or cardiovascular death). Secondary outcomes were the individual components of MACE, heart failure, and all cause mortality. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate site specific adjusted hazards ratios and 95\% confidence intervals, comparing use of SGLT2 inhibitors with use of DPP-4 inhibitors in an as treated approach. Site specific results were pooled using random effects meta-analysis.
Results Compared with DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with decreased risks of MACE (incidence rate per 1000 person years: 11.4 v 16.5; hazard ratio 0.76, 95\% confidence interval 0.69 to 0.84), myocardial infarction (5.1 v 6.4; 0.82, 0.70 to 0.96), cardiovascular death (3.9 v 7.7; 0.60, 0.54 to 0.67), heart failure (3.1 v 7.7; 0.43, 0.37 to 0.51), and all cause mortality (8.7 v 17.3; 0.60, 0.54 to 0.67). SGLT2 inhibitors had more modest benefits for ischaemic stroke (2.6 v 3.5; 0.85, 0.72 to 1.01). Similar benefits for MACE were observed with canagliflozin (0.79, 0.66 to 0.94), dapagliflozin (0.73, 0.63 to 0.85), and empagliflozin (0.77, 0.68 to 0.87).
Conclusions In this large observational study conducted in a real world clinical practice context, the short term use of SGLT2 inhibitors was associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular events compared with the use of DPP-4 inhibitors.

	abstract = {Introduction
The International Methodology Consortium for Coded Health Information (IMeCCHI) is a collaboration of health services researchers who promote methodological advances in coded health information. The IMeCCHI-DATANETWORK initiative focuses on developing a multi-purpose distributed data infrastructure and common data model (CDM) to enable cross-border data sharing and international comparisons.

Methods
IMeCCHI consortium partners from six different countries – Canada, Denmark, Italy, New Zealand, South Korea, and Switzerland – used a questionnaire to describe their original databases which differ in size, structure, content and coding systems. To standardize these data, they agreed on a CDM and mapped their population-based databases to meet the CDM specifications. At the end of this process, local data had a more homogenous content and structure, which made them syntactically and semantically interoperable. Data transformation was performed using a common data management software called TheMatrix. 

Results
The CDM encompasses four tables of structured data (person characteristics, hospitalizations, outpatient prescription medication and death), linked at the individual level through a person identifier. It can be used to answer research questions across countries using locally converted databases, which facilitates study replication in a distributed fashion. As a proof-of-concept study, an initial research question was addressed using an agreed protocol. Local data were transformed in csv files in the CDM structure and TheMatrix was tested to transform the standardized data from each partner into local analytical datasets. This allowed results to be shared between countries, whilst maintaining local control over each region’s data.

Conclusion
The IMeCCHI-DATANETWORK, a model of a distributed data network, demonstrated that it is feasible to analyze international data using standardized analytical methods that enable independent analyses by regions, without relocating datasets thereby protecting local confidentiality obligations. The distributed data infrastructure can produce results that can be generalized to several countries, while facilitating cross-border data sharing and international comparisons.

Researchers often consider six scientific domains when choosing among these options—study design, exposure type, outcome type, covariate summarization technique, covariate adjustment method, and data sharing approach. This article reviews available analytic and data sharing options and discusses key scientific and practical considerations when choosing among these options in multidatabase studies of comparative effectiveness and safety of medical products. The scientific considerations must be balanced against what the data-contributing sites are able or willing to share. While pooling of person-level data sets remains the most familiar and analytically flexible approach, newer analytic and data sharing approaches that share less granular summary-level information may be equally valid and preferred in some multidatabase studies, especially when sharing of person-level data is challenging or infeasible.},

In this study, we compare the provincial administrative databases and illustrate the potential impact of database differences on a CNODES study about domperidone and the risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (VT/SCD). Methods We assessed the impact of varying versions and precision of the International Classification of Diseases coding system in physician claims data, and the content and completeness of hospital discharge abstracts across CNODES sites, as these variations can introduce differences in the study cohorts formed and affect study results. Results In our study of 214 962 patients, hospital diagnosis type (such as most responsible, admitting, or secondary diagnosis) was missing in some provinces, resulting in misclassification of the outcome and variation in rates and risk estimates. Incidence rates of VT/SCD ranged from 19.8 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 17.7-22.2) per 10 000 person-years in British Columbia to 53.4 (95\% CI 50.3-56.5) in Quebec. While most provinces reported an increased risk of VT/SCD, a null effect was observed in Quebec (rate ratio 1.06; 95\% CI 0.79-1.41). Conclusions Distributed analyses allow for rapid responses to drug safety signals. However, variation in characteristics of the administrative data across research centres can influence study results. By identifying the sources of database heterogeneity, one can evaluate the potential biases these differences may introduce, highlighting the importance of considering such variation in distributed networks.},

	abstract = {Aim To compare urosepsis rates in patients with type 2 diabetes treated using sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) in a real-world setting. Methods We conducted a matched cohort study using a prevalent new-user design with time-conditional propensity scores. New users of SGLT2i from seven Canadian provinces and the UK were matched to DPP4i users. The primary outcome was hospitalization with a diagnosis of urosepsis and the secondary outcome was Fournier's gangrene. Site-specific hazard ratios for urosepsis comparing SGLT2i with DPP4i were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models and pooled using a random effects meta-analysis. Results We included 208 244 users of SGLT2i and 208 244 users of DPP4i. Among SGLT2i users, 42\% initiated canagliflozin, 31\% dapagliflozin and 27\% empagliflozin. During a mean follow-up of 0.9 years, patients initiating SGLT2i had a lower rate of urosepsis compared with those receiving DPP4i. The pooled adjusted hazard ratio was 0.58 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.42-0.80). The incidence rates of Fournier's gangrene were numerically similar in SGLT2i (0.08 per 1000 person-years; 95\% CI: 0.05-0.13) and DPP4i users (0.14; 95\% CI: 0.09-0.21). Conclusions In this large, multi-site study, we did not observe an increased risk for urosepsis associated with SGLT2i compared with DPP4i among patients with type 2 diabetes in a real-world setting.},

	abstract = {Purpose To use the Canadian Network for Observational Drug Effect Studies (CNODES) to describe drug utilization of antidiabetic medications in four Canadian provinces. Methods With the use of data from CNODES, we constructed cohorts of patients with type 2 diabetes in four Canadian provinces (Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan) who received their first-ever prescription for a noninsulin antidiabetic medication during the study period, defined as the earliest date of data availability in each province (range: 1993-1998) to the latest date of the data extraction in each province (range: 2013-2014). Prescriptions rates were calculated for all prescriptions by class and described over time. Results Across provinces, we identified 650 830 patients who initiated antidiabetic medications during the study period. In most provinces, the overall prescription rate of antidiabetic medications increased during the last two decades. Metformin particularly increased in popularity, surpassing sulfonylureas in all provinces as the most widely prescribed antidiabetic medication by the early 2000s. Thiazolidinediones grew in popularity from the onset of their availability until 2006 to 2007, at which point they rapidly declined. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors saw substantial growth in several provinces following their addition to provincial formularies in 2008 to 2012, while glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists experienced modest growth. Insulin prescription rates remained constant or steadily increased over the last two decades. Conclusions CNODES can be used for cross-jurisdictional drug utilization studies. In Canada, trends in antidiabetic medication prescriptions followed changing guidelines reflecting up-to-date knowledge of drug effectiveness and safety.},

	abstract = {Although postmarketing studies conducted in population-based databases often contain information on patients in the order of millions, they can still be underpowered if outcomes or exposure of interest is rare, or the interest is in subgroup effects. Combining several databases might provide the statistical power needed. A multi-database study (MDS) uses at least two healthcare databases, which are not linked with each other at an individual person level, with analyses carried out in parallel across each database applying a common study protocol. Although many MDSs have been performed in Europe in the past 10 years, there is a lack of clarity on the peculiarities and implications of the existing strategies to conduct them. In this review, we identify four strategies to execute MDSs, classified according to specific choices in the execution: (A) local analyses, where data are extracted and analyzed locally, with programs developed by each site; (B) sharing of raw data, where raw data are locally extracted and transferred without analysis to a central partner, where all the data are pooled and analyzed; (C) use of a common data model with study-specific data, where study-specific data are locally extracted, loaded into a common data model, and processed locally with centrally developed programs; and (D) use of general common data model, where all local data are extracted and loaded into a common data model, prior to and independent of any study protocol, and protocols are incorporated in centrally developed programs that run locally. We illustrate differences between strategies and analyze potential implications.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the relationships of subjects in the context of data and data technologies, and advances an original theoretical framework called Informatic Personhood to better conceptual subjects and their relationships. Because of the enormous structural change that data has contributed to, subjects are sometimes distant and backgrounded in studies of data, despite data having significant impacts on their lives. Data-mediated relationships mean an increased scale to a relationship, with individuals able to connect to much broader contexts of data, but also have these structures reach down to their subjective context through data. Informatic Personhood seeks to capture the dynamics of data present in everyday life, addressing this distance and better conceptualising the scale of data-mediated relationships. This framework has two parts. The first – The Informatic Context – explores salient structural developments around data and conceptualises this as being defined by the presence of ‘data interfaces’ (that connect individuals to digital contexts), ‘data circulation’ (trends in the movement and storage of data), and ‘data abstraction’ (data manipulation practices). The second part concerns the Informatic Person, and the embodied, affective, and sensemaking relationships of individuals occurring across and through the Informatic Context. This framework better addresses the scale of data-mediated relationships, and places subjects firmly in the foreground of how data is understood.},

There has been significant interest in the economic exploitation of copyright in recent years in light of substantial growth of investment in and output of copyright-based industries around the world. Moreover, country-specific studies suggest that copyright industries have grown faster than the whole economy in most countries, signalling their importance for economic growth. This study attempts to fill the gaps in the data and economic analysis in this area by estimating the contribution and trend of copyright-based industries in the Canadian economy. The main variables of interest this study explores are value-added and employment. The study is based on the framework developed by the World Intellectual Property Organization, so as to make international comparisons possible. Specifically, the study compares the contribution of the core copyright-based industries in Canada with that of the United States and the European Union.

Eventually Web 2.0 resolved this contradiction by providing an architecture where information could be both free and expensive. Web 2.0 was not a product of technological advances: social media, wikis, big data platforms, and so forth. It was borne out of the understanding that free information on media platforms could yield profitable data on users.

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the decision-making process of librarians at the University of Western Ontario who attempted to cancel the Wiley Big Deal. The aim of the study is to reveal the underlying factors that affected their decision-making process. By understanding the decision-making process of librarians, it may be possible to devise a system that takes into consideration not only quantitative factors but also the subjective or qualitative factors that impact librarians’ decisions and thus make it easier to cancel these Big Deals. Design/methodology/approach The study involved administering an online survey to 25 librarians involved in the cancellation project. Follow-up interviews were conducted with 13 of these librarians to understand at a deeper and more nuanced level the factors that influenced their decisions. Findings The main finding was that the librarians who participated in the study could be divided into two groups – a data-driven criteria group and a subjective criteria group – based on their ranking of the factors used to make their cancellation decisions. Most librarians interviewed used a mixture of quantitative factors and qualitative factors when making their cancellation decisions. The authors found that those participants who had greater professional experience and a closer relationship with the faculties in their subject areas had more difficulty in cancelling journals. Very few librarians relied on quantitative data alone. Originality/value This study is one of few that have examined the subjective factors that influence librarians’ decisions regarding cancellation of Big Deals. It has implications regarding the movement towards centralized collection management and reliance on quantitative data alone when making collection decisions.},

	abstract = {The Copyright Act includes a set of copyright infringement exceptions that permit the unauthorized use of copyrighted works in order to serve public interest objectives. The Supreme Court of Canada liberally interpreted these exceptions as “users’ rights” by relying on the purpose of the Act, understood as a balance between the authors’ right to be rewarded for their works and the public interest in the dissemination and use of works. The utility of copyright balance to safeguard users’ rights is uncertain. The Act does not explicitly adopt “balance” as a purpose. National and international copyright law traditionally recognize the users’ side in the copyright law balance in copyright exceptions and limitations. And, in copyright law discourse, different stakeholders propose and defend conflicting forms of balance. Therefore, the paper argues that a human rights-based approach to copyright exceptions is more persuasive in justifying their interpretation as users’ rights. Copyright users’ rights mirror the content of the human rights to participate in culture, education, and freedom of expression, which Canada is obliged to implement as a State Party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The proposed approach would align the discourse with key elements of Canadian jurisprudence: (1) human rights as reinforcers of the rule of law; (2) international human rights law as an interpretive tool for Canadian courts; and (3) the need to interpret Canadian legislation in a manner that does not breach international obligations.},

As shown by their high impact factors, these newly created journals benefit from the name recognition and reputation of the originals after which they are named. Plus, through a manuscript routing mechanism, the publishers recycle some of the submissions rejected by their highly selective flagship journal by redirecting those manuscripts, along with their reviews, to derivative journals or to one of the lower-impact journals on their list, which may require an article processing charge for publication.},

The major research questions are: first, to what extent have research topics regarding libraries as public sphere institutions expanded and diversified? Which theoretical perspectives inform research? Second, which challenges and topics does the research focus upon, such as: social inclusion and equal access to information; digital inequalities; censorship and freedom of expression; and access to places and spaces with a democratic potential and the role of libraries in that respect? Third, what influence has social media exerted on libraries in the context of the expanding digital world? Findings The authors identified mainly four themes regarding the public library and public sphere, such as: the importance of public libraries by using Habermas’s theory; the function of meeting places within the public library and setting those places in the center of the library in order to enhance and encourage democracy; the relationship between social inclusion and public libraries and its functions in current society such as diminishing the digital divide; and the emerging electronic resources and arena of SNS in public libraries and utilizing them to reach citizens.

The goal of this article is to introduce metascience to STS scholars, detail the scientific ideology that is apparent in its articles, strategy statements, and research projects, and discuss its institutional and intellectual future. Put simply, metascience is a scientific social movement that seeks to use the tools of science- especially, quantification and experimentation- to diagnose problems in research practice and improve efficiency. It draws together data scientists, experimental and statistical methodologists, and open science activists into a project with both intellectual and policy dimensions. Metascientists have been remarkably successful at winning grants, motivating news coverage, and changing policies at science agencies, journals, and universities. Moreover, metascience represents the apotheosis of several trends in research practice, scientific communication, and science governance including increased attention to methodological and statistical criticism of scientific practice, the promotion of “open science” by science funders and journals, the growing importance of both preprint and data repositories for scientific communication, and the new prominence of data scientists as research makes a turn toward Big Science.},

This project has pointed out the trouble with classification and cataloging decisions that are framed as objective and neutral but are always ideological and worked to correct bias in library structures. Viewing knowledge organization systems from a queer perspective, however, challenges the idea that classification and subject language can ever be finally corrected. Engaging queer theory and library classification and cataloging together requires new ways of thinking about how to be ethically and politically engaged on behalf of marginal knowledge formations and identities who quite reasonably expect to be able to locate themselves in the library. Queer theory invites a shift in responsibility from catalogers, positioned to offer functional solutions, to public services librarians, who can teach patrons to dialogically engage the catalog as a complex and biased text, just as critical catalogers do.},

We believe this task is a crucial component in algorithms that detect and follow research topics and in methods that measure the quality of publications.We model this task as a supervised classification problem at two levels of detail: a coarse one with classes (important vs. non-important), and a more detailed one with four importance classes. We annotate a dataset of approximately 450 citations with this information, and release it publicly. We propose a supervised classification approach that addresses this task with a battery of features that range from citation counts to where the citation appears in the body of the paper, and show that,our approach achieves a precision of 65\% for a recall of 90\%.},
