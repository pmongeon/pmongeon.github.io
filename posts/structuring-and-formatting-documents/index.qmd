# Part 1 - Structuring text {.smaller}

## Why structure matters {.smaller}

-   Your documents typically have readers; help them read and understand your work!
-   A cluttered text without structure can reflect or be interpreted as a lack of understanding.
-   Do it for you!

## Tools for formatting a document {.smaller}

-   Title
-   Headings
    -   Example for research articles: **I**ntroduction, **M**ethod, **R**esults **a**nd **D**iscussion (IMRaD).
-   Subheadings are generally recommended!
    -   [APA guidelines](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/paper-format/headings) for headings and subheadings formatting.
-   Paragraphs
    -   One paragraph per idea
    -   Topic sentence, supporting sentences, concluding sentence.
-   Bullet points and numbered lists
-   Table of contents
-   Styles and Templates in Microsoft Word (a time saver)
-   Zotero (for formatting references)

# Part 2 - Formatting tables {.smaller}

# Basic rules of tables formatting {.smaller}

@wilke2019 recommends to:

-   Avoid vertical lines
-   Avoid horizontal lines between data rows.
    -   Use them at the top and bottom of the table and to separate column headers from the content of the table.
-   Align text to the left.
-   Align numbers to the right and use the same number of decimals (no more than necessary) throughout.
-   Align columns containing single characters to the centre.
-   Align the column header the same way as the content of the columns.

## Tips {.smaller}

-   Keep your tables simple
-   In some cases, you may find it easier to
    -   Create your table in Excel
    -   Copy it in Word (as a table, **not** as an image)
    -   Then use Word to format the table.

# Part 3 - Formatting figures {.smaller}

-   All axes should be labelled
-   Principle of proportional ink (i.e. the y-axis should start at 0).
-   Use a colour palette only if it conveys information (not usually relevant unless more than two variables are used for the figure).
-   No border
-   No shade!
-   no 3D!
-   For guidance on selecting appropriate graph types, see [MGMT2505 - Working with data course (ch.Â 10 to 12)](https://pmongeon.github.io/mgmt2605/ch10.html).
