    "text": "Citation\nToupin, R., Krause, G., Riddle, P., Hare, M., & Mongeon, P. (2025). Identifying Ocean‐Related Literature Using the UN Second World Ocean Assessment Report. Ocean and Society, 2, Article 8924. https://doi.org/10.17645/oas.8924\n\n\nAbstract\nIn recent years, ocean governance has called for strategic action and science‐informed policy to work towards the sustainable development of the ocean, most notably as part of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021–2030). This common framework identifies the integration of scientific knowledge in governance as a key process to deliver solutions responding to the current challenges, opportunities, and transformations posed by global change in the oceans. This article presents a methodological approach for identifying ocean‐related research outputs and documenting research‐based knowledge integration in documents that inform ocean governance. Specifically, this study builds on an analysis of the references included in the UN Second World Ocean Assessment report to (a) identify and describe the research outputs cited in the distinct chapters of the report, (b) identify research outputs relevant to ocean governance through the analysis of citations from and to references included in the UN Second World Ocean Assessment, (c) compare both datasets to examine the position of the literature cited in the report within a broader ecosystem of ocean‐related research, and (d) present a method to identify topically relevant research that could be integrated in future ocean assessments. Our findings show distinct referencing practices across chapters and expert groups and a higher reliance on high‐profile sources in the report compared to a broader dataset of ocean research outputs. Moreover, this study highlights an innovative approach to identifying ocean research based on knowledge syntheses and considers discussion points about integrating research‐based knowledge in documents informing ocean governance.\n\n\nKey figures\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

Examining the geographic and linguistic coverage of gold and diamond open access journals in OpenAlex, Scopus and Web of Science. Quantitative Science Studies, 1–29. https://doi.org/10.1162/QSS.a.1\n\n\nAbstract\nDiamond open access (OA) is a publishing model that is free for both authors and readers, but its lack of indexing in major bibliographic databases compared to gold journals presents challenges in assessing its uptake. Furthermore, the characteristics of diamond journals, such as language and country of publication, have often been used to support the argument that they are more diverse and serve national research communities. However, there is a notable lack of empirical evidence regarding their geographical and linguistic characteristics. Using the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) as a benchmark, this paper investigates OA journals through their coverage in OpenAlex, Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus by field, country, and language. The results show the lower coverage of diamond journals in WoS and Scopus and confirm the national scope of diamond journals compared to gold. The share of English-only journals is considerably higher among gold journals in every database. High-income countries have the highest share of authorship in every domain and type of journal, except for diamond journals in the social sciences and humanities. Understanding the current landscape of diamond OA indexing can aid the scholarly communications community and decision-makers in advancing policy and practices toward more inclusive OA models.\n\n\nKey figures\n\n\n\nShare of journals by language, domain, and OA type.\n\n\n\n\n\nShare of journals by publishing country, domain, and OA type\n\n\n\n\nLinks\n\nFull paper\nCode"

A Bibliometric Analysis of Canadian LIS Scholars and Practitioners’ Research Contributions. The Canadian Journal of Information and Library Science / La Revue canadienne des sciences de l’information et de bibliothéconomie, 48(1), 20–35. https://doi.org/10.5206/cjils-rcsib.v48i1.22439\n\n\nAbstract\nCanada’s research productivity in Library and Information Science (LIS) is significant: studies have found that Canada ranks third globally in terms of output. As the LIS field continues to grow, the pace of output accelerates, and the scope of this work expands. The recently launched Canadian Publications in Library and Information Science Database compiles all Canadian scientific publications, including those authored by faculty members and academic librarians. This database offers the advantage of encompassing articles and librarian publications that may not be typically included in traditional bibliometric surveys, such as those conducted using databases like Web of Science, Scopus, and Library and Information Science Abstracts (LISA). Using this data, this study maps the scholarly contributions of Canadian LIS scholars and academic librarians to the field of LIS and examines whether Canadian LIS research is characterized by silos. This paper examines the similarities and differences in research output, impact, topics, and publication venues between academic librarians and scholars in Canada, as well as the extent to which academics and practitioners engage in research collaborations or reference each other’s work. We find that while there is some degree of overlap in research topics and publication venues between LIS academics and academic librarians, the two groups appear to act as distinct research communities with distinct topical foci and publishing habits. The two groups also do not appear to engage with each other strongly, either through collaboration or citing each other’s work.\n\n\nRésumé\nLa productivité de la recherche au Canada en bibliothéconomie et sciences de l’information (BSI) est significative : des études ont révélé que le Canada se classe au troisième rang mondial en termes de production. À mesure que le domaine continue de croître, le rythme de production s’accélère et la portée de ce travail s’élargit. La base de données récemment lancée des Publications canadiennes en bibliothéconomie et sciences de l’information compile les publications de membres du corps professoral et de bibliothécaires universitaires au Canada. Cette base de données offre l’avantage d’inclure des articles et des publications de bibliothécaires qui ne sont pas toujours inclus dans les enquêtes bibliométriques traditionnelles, telles que celles menées à l’aide de bases de données comme Web of Science, Scopus et Library and Information Science Abstracts (LISA). En utilisant ces données, cette étude cartographie les contributions scientifiques des chercheurs canadiens en BSI et des bibliothécaires universitaires au domaine et examine si la recherche canadienne en LIS est caractérisée par des silos. Cet article examine les similitudes et les différences dans la production de recherche, l’impact, les sujets et les lieux de publication entre les bibliothécaires universitaires et les chercheurs au Canada, ainsi que la mesure dans laquelle les universitaires et les praticiens s’engagent dans des collaborations de recherche ou se réfèrent aux travaux des uns et des autres. Nous constatons que, bien qu’il existe un certain degré de chevauchement dans les sujets de recherche et les lieux de publication entre les universitaires en LIS et les bibliothécaires universitaires, les deux groupes semblent constituer des communautés de recherche distinctes avec des focalisations thématiques et des habitudes de publication distinctes.

Quantitative Science Studies, 1–22. https://doi.org/10.1162/qss.a.5\n\n\nAbstract\nThe Villum Experiment (VEX) is one of the few funding schemes that employs a double-blind review process where applicants are blinded to reviewers, applications are highly standardized, reviewers do not deliberate, and funding is determined solely by ranked aggregated review scores. This unique controlled setting enables assumptions that direct reviewer gender bias is highly unlikely. Using a causal framework (DAG), we examine the extent to which gender disparities in funding may exist in such a setting. Our analyses of 2,041 applications from five funding rounds (2017–2021) reveal a small but consistent gender disparity in success rates, concentrated within the Life Science panel. As reviewer bias is unlikely in this setting, these disparities or structural inequalities are likely caused by differences in gender compositions across disciplines and the underrepresentation of highly experienced women among the applicants and in the population in general. Multilevel modeling with post-stratification indicates that accounting for these structural factors removes the disparity in funding success rates. Our findings highlight that gender disparity in funding may remain without direct review bias. In this case, such remaining disparities are likely rooted in broader structural inequalities within academia and/or compositional effects.\n\n\nKey figures\n\n\n\nFigure 1. The causal model. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) illustrating the proposed causal mechanisms that can lead to gendered differences in success rates for the Villum Experiment fund ing scheme. The dashed arrow from gender to funding illustrates that blinded reviews should ideally remove the potential direct effect, as gender bias in reviews is rendered impossible. Purple nodes are intermediate variables signifying different indirect effects from gender to funding outcome. Potential indirect effects are represented in the DAG as paths through purple nodes. The gray node is an unobserved, possibly confounding, factor."

FACETS, 8, 1–31. https://doi.org/10.1139/facets-2023-0005\n\n\nAbstract\nWhen researchers are sufficiently resourced to conduct research and communicate their findings, the knowledge produced can benefit the environment and society through policy. However, interference with the research process and its subsequent knowledge mobilization (“interference in science”) has been observed in several countries, particularly for environmental researchers. Using a mixed-methods approach, we surveyed environmental researchers in Canada (n = 741) to investigate the perceived prevalence, source, and effects of interference and considered whether these perceptions differ by region, career stage, research area, and membership in any scientific society. Although over half of researchers were not restricted from speaking to the media (54%), and most had never been asked to make “undue modifications” to their work (84%), the vast majority (92%) reported at least some degree of interference in their work during their careers. Consequences of interference were more prevalent among early-career researchers and included negative impacts on job satisfaction, mental health, and undue modification to work leading to inaccurate or incomplete science communication. Although environmental researchers in Canada deem themselves overall better able to conduct and communicate their work than under previous federal governments, reports of ongoing political interference remain concerning. We recommend increased support for researchers and further investigations into interference.\n\n\nKey figures\n\n\n\nFig. 6.

Quantitative Science Studies, 5(2), 332‑350. https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00296\n\n\nAbstract\nThe last decade of altmetrics research has demonstrated that altmetrics have a low to moderate correlation with citations, depending on the platform and the discipline, among other factors. Most past studies used academic works as their unit of analysis to determine whether the attention they received on Twitter was a good predictor of academic engagement. Our work revisits the relationship between tweets and citations where the tweet itself is the unit of analysis, and the question is to determine if, at the individual level, the act of tweeting an academic work can shed light on the likelihood of the act of citing that same work. We model this relationship by considering the research activity of the tweeter and its relationship to the tweeted work. The results show that tweeters are more likely to cite works affiliated with their same institution, works published in journals in which they also have published, and works in which they hold authorship. It finds that the older the academic age of a tweeter the less likely they are to cite what they tweet, though there is a positive relationship between citations and the number of works they have published and references they have accumulated over time.\n\n\nKey figures\n\n\n\nCitation rates by sociotopical characteristics.\n\n\n\n\nLinks\n\nDataset"

PLOS ONE, 17(8), e0272730. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0272730\n\n\nAbstract\nOpen Access (OA) dissemination has been gaining a lot of momentum over the last decade, thanks to the implementation of several OA policies by funders and institutions, as well as the development of several new platforms that facilitate the publication of OA content at low or no cost. Studies have shown that nearly half of the contemporary scientific literature could be available online for free. However, few studies have compared the use of OA literature across countries. This study aims to provide a global picture of OA adoption by countries, using two indicators: publications in OA and references made to articles in OA. We find that, on average, low-income countries are publishing and citing OA at the highest rate, while upper middle-income countries and higher-income countries publish and cite OA articles at below world-average rates. These results highlight national differences in OA uptake and suggest that more OA initiatives at the institutional, national, and international levels are needed to support wider adoption of open scholarship.\n\n\nKey figures\n\n\n\nFig 1.

However, there is a lack of research that examines these activities, particularly at the author level. This paper explores the activity of researchers in the Twittersphere by analyzing a large database of Web of Science authors systematically identified on Twitter using data from Altmetric.com. Using this information, this paper explores and compares patterns of tweeted and self-tweeted publications with other academic activities, such as citations, self citations, and authorship at the author level. This paper also compares the thematic orientation among these different activities by analyzing the similarity of the research topics of the publications tweeted, cited, and authored. The results show that the productivity and impact of researchers, as defined by conventional bibliometric indicators, are not correlated to their popularity on the Twitter platform and that scholars generally tend to tweet about topics closely related to the publications they author and cite. These findings suggest that social media metrics capture a broader aspect of the academic workflow that is most likely related to science communication, dissemination, and engagement with wider audiences and that differs from conventional forms of impact as captured by citations.

PLOS ONE, 16(5), e0251488. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251488\n\n\nAbstract\nResearch funding is an important factor for public science. Funding may affect which research topics get addressed, and what research outputs are produced. However, funding has often been studied simplistically, using top-down or system-led perspectives. Such approaches often restrict analysis to confined national funding landscapes or single funding organizations and instruments in isolation. This overlooks interlinkages, broader funding researchers might access, and trends of growing funding complexity. This paper instead frames a ‘bottom-up’ approach that analytically distinguishes between increasing levels of aggregation of funding instrument co-use. Funding of research outputs is selected as one way to test this approach, with levels traced via funding acknowledgements (FAs) in papers published 2009–18 by researchers affiliated to Denmark, the Netherlands or Norway, in two test research fields (Food Science, Renewable Energy Research). Three funding aggregation levels are delineated: at the bottom, ‘funding configurations’ of funding instruments co-used by individual researchers (from single-authored papers with two or more FAs); a middle, ‘funding amalgamations’ level, of instruments co-used by collaborating researchers (from multi-authored papers with two or more FAs); and a ‘co-funding network’ of instruments co-used across all researchers active in a research field (all papers with two or more FAs). All three levels are found to include heterogenous funding co-use from inside and outside the test countries. There is also co-funding variety in terms of instrument ‘type’ (public, private, university or non-profit) and ‘origin’ (domestic, foreign or supranational). Limitations of the approach are noted, as well as its applicability for future analyses not using paper FAs to address finer details of research funding dynamics.\n\n\nKey figures\n\n\n\nFig 1.

Its explicit purpose is to address the lack of research on race and inequity within our field. The purpose of this contribution to the issue is to substantiate that statement by performing a bibliometric analysis of the last 40 years of LIS scholarship to quantify the amount of attention given to race and racial inequality over that period. We find that despite an important increase in BIPOC-related research in LIS, the numbers remain quite low with approximately 2% of LIS publications containing terms related to racial inequality and BIPOC communities, and this research also tends to be less cited than the average LIS papers in the same area. We also find that this research is present in several areas of the field, although unevenly distributed across them. The trends presented in this paper may help when discussing sensitive issues regarding systematic discrimination, help create and sustain momentum towards change, and address the persistent lack of diverse perspectives and approaches across LIS scholarship and practice.\n\n\nKey figures\n\n\n\nFig. 4.

Using data derived from Ulrich’s Periodical Directory and Clarivate Analytics’s Web of Science, this paper suggests providing empirical evidence supporting of such shift, as revealed by an overview of the dissemination practices in architecture scholarly production between 1980 and 2015. Our results support that architecture is becoming increasingly academic, as demonstrated by the growing proportion of articles and journals intended for scholars rather than for professionals. We also show that architecture is increasingly global, with decreased interest in local and/or national issues and the growing prevalence of English as a publication language. Finally, this academic focus is manifested in references cited by architectural papers with the gradual substitution of professional and artistic oriented knowledge, for scientific approaches tied to engineering and technology.\n\n\nKey figures\n\n\n\nFig 5.

Using publication data from WoS, OA status from Unpaywall, and annual APC prices from open data sets and historical fees retrieved via the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, we estimate that globally authors paid $1.06 billion in publication fees to these publishers from 2015–2018. Revenue from gold OA amounted to $612.5 million, and $448.3 million was obtained for publishing OA in hybrid journals. Among the five publishers, Springer Nature made the most revenue from OA ($589.7 million), followed by Elsevier ($221.4 million), Wiley ($114.3 million), Taylor & Francis ($76.8 million), and Sage ($31.6 million).

Different approaches have been implemented to identify and characterize active scholars on social media platforms like Twitter. Some limitations of past approaches were their complexity and, most importantly, their reliance on licensed scientometric and altmetric data. The emergence of new open data sources such as OpenAlex or Crossref Event Data provides opportunities to identify scholars on social media using only open data. This paper presents a novel and simple approach to match authors from OpenAlex with Twitter users identified in Crossref Event Data. The matching procedure is described and validated with ORCID data. The new approach matches nearly 500,000 matched scholars with their Twitter accounts with a level of high precision and moderate recall. The data set of matched scholars is described and made openly available to the scientific community to empower more advanced studies of the interactions of research scholars on Twitter.\n\n\nKey figures\n\n\n\nResults of the matching for each criterion"

Marine Policy, 157, 105829. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2023.105829\n\n\nAbstract\nShark conservation is an urgent and complex biodiversity matter. While research on sharks is an important output of the knowledge production processes that could inform conservation policy and management decisions, whether all relevant knowledge is reaching the public and policy-makers has been questioned. Concerns have been expressed that attention given to research is skewed towards specific and often more sensationalist topics that do not provide an accurate picture of the shark-related issues and of possible solutions to decision-makers and the general public. This study thus analysed Web of Science publications related to sharks to determine the degree of attention different areas of shark-related research received in science, social media, news media, and policy documents. Highly concentrated distributions of citations, and mentions in social media, news media, or policy documents were found, but little relationship exists between the attention that individual publications or research areas receive in the different spheres. These findings show the diversity of shark-related research and its audiences and suggest a need for research evaluation to acknowledge that research impact can take many forms. In addition, developing outreach strategies is needed to ensure that relevant research is adequately disseminated to the public and policy-makers. This study can help researchers, resource managers, and other stakeholders better understand the diverse body of scientific evidence that could be mobilized into policies and practices for shark conservation.\n\n\nKey figures\n\n\n\nScientific and media attention to shark research assessed through z-scores of citations, tweets, news, and policy mentions"

Minerva, 62(3), 397–426. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11024-024-09521-7\n\n\nAbstract\nThe notion of science as a stratified system is clearly manifested in the markedly uneven distribution of productivity, rewards, resources, and recognition. Although previous studies have shown that institutional environments for conducting research differ significantly between national science systems, disciplines, and subfields, it remains to be shown whether any systematic variations and patterns in inequalities exist among researchers in different national and domain specific settings. This study investigates the positioning of citation elites as opposed to ‘ordinary’ researchers by way of examining three dimensions of concentration (accumulation of publications and citations, specialisation, and institutional concentration) in biology, economics and physics in Denmark and the UK. Across all three dimensions, we put Richard Whitley’s bipartite theory to the test, suggesting a nexus between the intellectual structure of a discipline and the configuration of its elite. The study draws on a dataset of researchers who published most of their publications in either physics, biology, or economics over the 1980–2018 period and with at least one publication in 2017–2018 while affiliated to either a British or a Danish university. We find higher degrees of concentration in the UK compared to Denmark, and that physics and biology respectively display the greatest and lowest degree of concentration. Similar patterns in disciplinary differences are observed in both countries, suggesting that concentration patterns are largely rooted in disciplinary cultures and merely amplified by the national context.\n\n\nKey figures\n\n\n\nFig. 4 Distribution of elite (top 5% most cited) and non-elite scientists across institutions"

Over time, the soaring costs of journal bundles have strained library budgets, and librarians have worked to transition away from Big Deals. Cancellation projects are complex processes involving a large amount of time and labour. Past research has examined how librarians use quantitative and/or qualitative data to make decisions around cancellations, but few go inside the process to understand the subjective factors influencing librarians’ choices. This study investigates the decision-making practices and processes of librarians concerned with the cancellation of Big Deals through interviews conducted at four medium-sized Canadian institutions that underwent cancellation projects from 2015 to 2020. The institutions investigated in this study adopted similar practices in deciding what packages to unbundle and selecting their teams. Differences in how qualitative and quantitative data were used in forming analyses, and the communication methods to counteract opposition heavily influenced the relative success of each library. Libraries seemed most successful if they could perform nuanced and complex data analyses, involved their Liaison librarians in faculty consultations, had the strong support of administrators, and wrapped the project together with an integrated communications plan. A model describing the decision-making steps in the process of unbundling journal packages and the influences that impact each step is presented, followed by recommendations for engaging with each influencing factor, based on the findings of this study.\n\n\nKey figures\n\n\n\nFig 1.

However, our intent is not to compare the two rankings and explain the differences in their outcome, but to compare metadata records for the subset of publications that are indexed in both OpenAlex and WoS, with a focus on describing discrepancies and measuring their frequency. We do not consider WoS as a gold standard against which OpenAlex records can be tested for their quality. Instead, we consider each database as a benchmark for the other.Our research questions are as follows:\n\nRQ1: How frequent are discrepancies between WoS and OpenAlex records in terms of document type, language, publication year, and number of authors?\nRQ2: What share of records with discrepancies are correct in WoS, OpenAlex, neither, or both?\nRQ3: What explains these discrepancies?\n\nThe choice of the metadata elements selected for the study (document type, language, publication year, and number of authors) was guided by their use as factors for inclusion in the CWTS Leiden Ranking: articles and reviews (document type) in English (language) published in a three-year period (publication year). The same metadata are also relevant in the production of normalized indicators for bibliometric research more generally. Indeed, normalized indicators would typically aim to compare publications of the same type, published in the same year. Additionally, the number of authors tends to be the denominator when counting publications using the fractional counting method (also provided in the Leiden Ranking). Therefore, discrepancies in these metadata elements of publication records are more likely to have a direct effect on the outcome of bibliometric analysis.\nTo our knowledge, our study is the first to compare the metadata quality of the subset of publications indexed in both OpenAlex and WoS. Our findings may offer useful insights to those using or planning to use OpenAlex, and may also point to possible paths to correct matadata errors, which could be helpful for database providers. Our intent is not to establish best practices or to formulate recommendations for database creators or users, nor to determine which database is better than the other. Our study is solely motivated by the desire to contribute to a better understanding of our data sources."

    "text": "Identification of discrepancies\nFor each matching WoS and OpenAlex record, we compared the following four metadata elements: 1) document type, 2) language, 3) publication year, and 4) number of authors.\nFor the document type, we did not consider discrepancies where a record is a review according to WoS and an article according to OpenAlex, and vice versa (i.e., we consider articles and reviews as the same document type). Furthermore, OpenAlex indexes conference papers as articles, and the source type (conference) is meant to distinguish them from journal articles. For these reasons, we only considered discrepancies for which the record is identified as an article or a review in either WoS or OpenAlex, but is identified as neither in the other source. We also excluded discrepancies for which the record is a meeting abstract in WoS and an article in OpenAlex. Overall, we found 429,692 discrepancies that met these criteria (6.5% of all records in the dataset).\nThe identification of discrepancies in language, publication year, and number of authors was limited to the subset of 5,936,235 articles and reviews with no discrepancy in document type (i.e., the records that are articles or reviews in both WoS and OpenAlex). The publication language is recorded in its long form (e.g., English) in our WoS data and its ISO code (e.g., en) in OpenAlex, so we created a list of all language combinations (e.g., English-EN, English-FR), determined which ones constitute discrepancies, and identified 33,516 discrepancies (0.6% of all articles and reviews) in publication language between WoS and OpenAlex.\nThe publication year and number of authors being numeric indicators, identifying discrepancies in these metadata fields is easily done by calculating the difference between the two values and flagging all non-zero values. We identified a total of 480,884 discrepancies (8.1% of all articles and reviews) in publication years and 71,133 discrepancies (1.2% of all articles and reviews) in the number of authors. We recorded them both as dichotomous variables (discrepancy vs no discrepancy) and as differences between the two values, which allowed us to measure both the frequency and the strength of the discrepancies.\nWe obtain the direction and extent of the discrepancies by substracting the OpenAlex publication year or number of author from the WoS values. A difference of 1 indicates that according to WoS the article was published one year (or has one more author) later than according to OpenAlex. Inversely, a difference of -1 indicates that the articles was published one year ealier (or has one fewer author) according to WoS than according to OpenAlex. We then and grouped cases in the bins (-4 or less, -2 to -3, -1, 1, 2 to 3, 4 or more)."

For cases in which the online publication year was recorded in one database and the issue year was recorded in the other, we did not consider either database to be correct.\nFor author discrepancies, the landing page and, when available, the published version was examined for author counts. Where available, author declarations, acknowledgements, and CRediT declarations were also considered to clarify authorship where groups or consortia were involved in the production of the work. For languages, the full text was the primary source, followed by the publisher’s landing page for recording observations on language assignment. We recorded multiple language full texts if available, as well as translated abstracts available on the landing page. There are limitations to using the publisher landing page with a web browser.  The language encoding in the head of the HTML could be used by the GET request to display your preferred language type, if the server is configured to respond to such a request.\nThis process allowed us to go beyond the simple counting of differences between the databases and gain insight into the different factors that can cause discrepancies and estimate the percentage of erroneous records in each database. One caveat, of course, is that because our process relies on discrepancies in identifying errors, we are not considering cases where both databases contain the same error."

However, WoS is much more accurate at detecting misclassifications in OpenAlex (93.5% of the sample) than in WoS (68.8% of the sample).

It is important to note, once again, that our results are note meant to reflect the compositon of the entire databases, but only the subset of documents included in both, which expectedly underestimate the representation of non-English literature especially on the OpenAlex side. Also important to reiterate here is that we our WoS data includes only the SCI-E, SSCI, and A&HCI, and not the ESCI which would include more non-English records.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Distribution of records by language in WoS\n\n\n\nLanguage in WoSRecordsnpctEnglish5,895,51599.31German14,4530.24Spanish7,9690.13French6,1720.10Chinese3,9150.07Russian1,9780.03Portuguese1,5260.03Polish8730.01Japanese7730.01Turkish5800.01Other2,4810.04Total5,936,235100.00\n\n\n\n\n\nAside from the dominance of English in the dataset, we also observe differences in the languages that compose the top 10 in each database, as well as in their ranking.

On the other hand, Chinese is the 5th most prevalent language in the WoS data, but does not make the top 10 in OpenAlex. Since these are supposed to be the same set of records, these differences point to significant discrepancies in the language between the two databases.\n\n\n\n\nTable 6: Distribution of records by language in OpenAlex\n\n\n\nLanguage in OpenAlexRecordsnpctEnglish5,886,86499.17Spanish13,7770.23German13,2440.22French10,4660.18Portugese3,2030.05Polish1,0580.02Turkish9090.02Hungarian8410.01Croatian5910.01Romanian5370.01Other3,6530.06Unknown1,0920.02Total5,936,235100.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage Discrepancies\nFor this part of the analysis, we focus on articles and review that are in English in Web of Science or in OpenAlex, and in a language other than English in the other database. In other words, we do not investigate discrepancies between Portuguese and Spanish or French and German, but only discrepancies for which one of the languages is English (e.g., English-German, English-Chinese).\nTable 7 and Table 8 respectively display the number of discrepancies found for articles in English in WoS and articles in English in OpenAlex. They also display the number of records manually investigated to determine whether the discrepancies stem from mislabeling non-English content as English, as well as the result of that investigation. To understand how an incorrect assignment may have occurred, we looked at the abstracts and full text on the landing page as well as the full text when it was available. Most sampled works seem to have multi-language abstracts either on the landing page or in the PDF of the full text. Also, some articles are published in multiple language, meaning that for some of the discrepancies observed, both OpenAelx and WoS are correct.\nA first observation is that WoS appears to be more accurate than OpenALex in terms of publication language. Table Only 20,086 English publications in the WoS were in another language according to OpenAlex, and in slightly less than half (48.2%) of the verified cases, the article was in fact in English.\n\n\n\n\nTable 7: Language discrepancies for articles and reviews in English in WoS\n\n\n\nLanguage in OpenAlexDiscrepanciesSampleErrorsnpctnpctnpctSpanish7,02934.812838.08264.1French5,58027.610130.03130.7Portugese2,11110.43811.32360.5German1,5987.9267.7830.8Romanian5292.682.400.0Hungarian5202.692.79100.0Turkish4642.361.8583.3Croatian4002.041.200.0Polish2901.430.93100.0Other1,6908.4144.2642.9Total20,211100.0337100.016749.6\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, we notice that for some languages, such as French, German, Romanian and Croatian, the discrepancies correctly flagged articles mislabelled as English in WoS, although the sample sizes for Romanian and Croatian were quite small.

We obtain the direction and extent of the discrepancies by substracting the OpenAlex publication year from the WoS publication year. A difference of 1 indicates that according to WoS the article was published one year later than accoridng to OpenAlex. Inversely, a difference of -1 indicates that the articles was published one year ealier accoring to WoS than according to OpenAlex.\n\n\n\n\nTable 10: Number of publication year discrepancies for articles and reviews in WoS and OpenAlex (total and sampled)\n\n\n\nDifference in publication year (WoS - OpenAlex)DiscrepanciesSamplenpctnpct-2 to -32,5490.5205.1-158,52612.2389.61392,68181.727670.12 to 323,1664.8205.1&lt; -32,0690.4205.1Total480,884100.0394100.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation for Publication Year Discrepancies\nFrom our investigation of the discrepancies, we observed four general possible publication year that one record can have in either database:\n\nIssue year: the year of the journal issue in which the article is officially published. This is also the year included in the reference to the article.\nFirst publication year: the year in which the article was first published online before it was assigned to an issue.\nOther year: another year that is recorded in the article’s history but is not a publication year (e.g., submission year, accepted year).\nSource unclear: we use this code when the publication year in the WoS or OpenAlex record does not match any of the years listed in in the landing page or the PDF.\n\nWe used these four scenarios to group publication year discrepancies between WoS and OpenAlex into six categories. The first two are 1) OA has first year, WoS has issue year and 2) OA has issue year, WoS has first year. In these cases, we considered both databases to be correct because both dates are actually referring to a publication event. The following four categories indicate errors in one of the databases that include none of the two accepted publication years: 3) OA has other year, 4) OA source unclear, 5) WoS has other year, and 6) WoS source unclear.\nAs shown in Figure 1, erroneous publication years are rare overall in the sample that we analyzed and mostly occur when there are significant discrepancies between the WoS and OpenAlex publication years. However, these errors appear to be more prevalent in OpenAlex. For half of the sampled articles published 2 or 3 years later according to OpenAlex compared to WoS, the source of the OpenAlex publication year was not found on the article landing page or PDF and appeared to be wrong. This was also the case for 20% of the articles with a publication year in OpenAlex three or more years earlier than in the WoS. In contrast, we only found a few instances (four in total) where the WoS publication year appeared to be erroneous.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows that discrepancies for which the OpenAlex year is prior to the WoS year are largely explained by cases where OpenAlex has the first publication year and WoS has the issue year, especially when the discrepancy is small (one year). This is expected given that the first publication year is typically before the journal issue year. Inversely, most cases in which the WoS publication year is prior to the OpenAlex publication year are explained by cases where WoS has the first publication year and OpenAlex has the journal issue year. Interestingly, neither database appears to be systematic in the way it indexes the year of first publication or the year of the journal issue."

For these cases, many of the discrepancies are explained by what appears to be a different treatment of group authors by OpenAlex and WoS. As shown in Table 13, OpenAlex appears to be counting as authors each member of the group listed on the byline, but only when that list is displayed on the landing page. However, the group tends to be ignored when its members are not listed on the landing page. WoS usually does not count members of a group listed on the byline as authors, regardless of whether or not the names appear on the landing page.\n\n\n\n\nTable 13: Treatment of group authors in WoS and OpenAlex relative to the presence of the group members list on the landing page.\n\n\n\nGroup authors on landing pageOpenAlexWoSCountedIgnoredCountedIgnoredNo465168Yes3710839\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile group members are typically not counted as authors in WoS, the group itself typically is. For example, a paper with two authors and a group with 10 members will have an author count of 3 in WoS. Conversely, OpenAlex does not include the group in the author count, so the same paper will typically have an author count of 2 or 12, depending on whether the group members appeared on the landing page.\nFor papers with a group author, OpenAlex and WoS having a different author count for the same paper does not mean that either database contains the correct number of authors. However, for publications that do not have group authors, determining which database has the correct author count is more straightforward. As shown in Table 14, OpenAlex was more likely to be correct (74.8% of the time) in these cases.\n\n\n\n\nTable 14: Number and share of valid records in OpenAlex and WoS in cases of author count discrepancies with no group authors listed on the byline.\n\n\n\nbinSampleOpenAlexWoSnpctnpctnpct&lt; -364.7583.3116.7-2 to -386.3787.5112.5-14434.63988.6511.412620.52388.5311.52 to 32721.31970.4829.6&gt; 31612.6212.51487.5Total127100.09574.83225.2"

As part of a larger project entitled “Breaking down research silos”, we created a database of research contributions by Canadian LIS researchers (academics and practitioners). This was motivated by a desire to make research by Canadian LIS scholars and practitioners more visible and foster collaboration between these two groups. The aim of this paper is to introduce the database, describe the process through which it was created, provide descriptive statistics of the database content, and highlight areas for future development.\n\n\nRésumé\nL’objectif de la base de données des publications canadiennes en bibliothéconomie et sciences de l’information (BSI) est de contribuer à briser les silos dans lesquels les deux principaux publics cibles – les membres du corps professoral en BSI et les bibliothécaires universitaires – mènent leurs recherches. Dans le cadre d’un projet plus vaste intitulé « Briser les silos de la recherche », nous avons créé une base de données des contributions de recherche des chercheurs canadiens en BSI (universitaires et praticiens). Cette initiative a été motivée par le désir de rendre la recherche des universitaires et praticiens canadiens en BSI plus visible et de favoriser la collaboration entre ces deux groupes.

    "text": "Methodological Approach\nThis descriptive study uses a bibliometric approach to measure engagement with GESAMP publications, and we thus define engagement as references to GESAMP publications in other documents. Specifically, we aim to collect evidence of engagement in three social spheres (research, policy, and news media), each represented by a distinct type of document (peer-reviewed research outputs, policy documents, and news items). We use ‘engagement’ as an all-encompassing term that encompasses all forms and varying degrees of engagement. Forms of engagement can include a mention of GESAMP or of a specific GESAMP publication, or the citation of a GESAMP publication in a research article. In either case, the mention or reference to GESAMP can occur without an in-depth report or use of the information included in the GESAMP publication, which we could qualify as a weak form of engagement; on the other hand, the GESAMP publication may be extensively discussed in the referencing or mentioning piece, which would signal a stronger form of engagement. Our work does not account for such variations in the degree of engagement.\nAs mentioned in the introduction, measuring the use of grey literature is methodologically challenging, primarily due to the lack of data infrastructures specifically designed for this purpose. Similarly, there are relatively standard ways of measuring engagement with scholarly outputs in social media, such as PlumX and Altmetric.com. However, these databases only cover gray literature that contains references to scholarly outputs with DOIs for the purpose of identifying citations to scholarly outputs in grey literature and other documents such as social media, blogs, and news media. These tools, which are widely used in bibliometric research, are not helpful for our purposes; therefore, we had to rely on various manual searches for GESAMP and GESAMP publications in different databases that index the types of documents we are interested in. We describe the data collection process in the following sections."

We use the generic term “publications” to refer to all these works. We collected information about 120 publications published between 1969 and 2022. Table 1 provides a list of the information collected on GESAMP publications.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Fields used to document GESAMP reports.\n\n\n\nFieldDescriptionIDA unique identifier for the publication.

This data was obtained through the Observatoire des sciences et des technologies (OST) at the Université du Québec à Montréal. We searched for the strings “gesamp” and “group of experts on the scientific aspects of marine” in three locations: 1) the cited reference author, 2) the cited reference title, and 3) the cited reference source. It is worth noting that these fields of the Web of Science database contain minimally processed or cleaned data. For example, there were 399 text strings representing GESAMP as the cited reference author. Overall, we retrieved 3,489 distinct reference strings (i.e., references in which GESAMP was mentioned) from a total of 4,713 references across 4,082 distinct publications. For each citing document, we retrieved the publication year and the journal, which allows us to show temporal trends as well as provides insights on the research communities where GESAMP plays a role.\n\n\nPolicy Citations\nTo collect citations to GESAMP publications in policy documents, we used the Overton database, an index of policy documents, guidelines, think tank publications and working papers, with a better coverage than alternative data sources such as Altmetric.com (Dorta-González et al., 2024; Maleki & Holmberg, 2024; Murat et al., 2023). Overton provides citation contexts by indicating where a scholarly output is used in the text of a policy document (when a bibliography section is provided in a policy document, it maps to its DOI) (Szomszor & Adie, 2022). As the referencing practices of grey literature can vary, Overton typically relies on a set of scored features to capture citations. If the overall score exceeds a certain threshold, the citation context is matched to Crossref to capture citations to scholarly literature or the rest of the Overton database for policy documents. Overton’s records include information on the authors of policy documents, source type (e.g., government, think tank), document topics, associated Sustainable Development Goals and the name of the source organization that produced the policy document (e.g., UNESCO, Institute for European Environmental Policy, Government of Canada), which can provide insights into not just how many policy documents cite GESAMP publications, but also who cites them and in what context.\nWe searched for each individual GESAMP publication in Overton using their titles, and we also searched for the term “GESAMP”. We identified most (118 out of 120) GESAMP publications in Overton. Two GESAMP publications – Report of the 32nd Session of GESAMP (#73) and Guidance on Assessment of Sediment Quality (#4) – are unavailable digitally as of December 2024. Thus, they were not included in the Overton database, and we were unable to collect policy citations for these two documents.\nInitially, we identified a total of 2,112 references to GESAMP publications in Overton. This number dropped to 742 after removing references coming from other GESAMP publications. Most of the removed 1,370 GESAMP self-citations were due to the fact that GESAMP reports tend to include a list of past GESAMP reports at the end, which were captured as individual references to each report by Overton, thus largely inflating the numbers. The 742 references included in the analysis occurred in 551 distinct documents produced by 103 organizations.\n\n\nNews Mentions\nNews articles were collected from five databases: Factiva, Eurêka, ProQuest News and Newspapers, NexisUni, and Research Library, chosen for their international scope and the relevance of their available resources. \nFactiva indexes news from over 33,000 sources globally. Emphasizing business and market intelligence data, the available sources include newspapers, trade publications, government publications, and press releases. A search for “GESAMP” or “group of experts on the scientific aspect of marine” retrieved 401 results, exported as headline data in HTML and converted to Comma Separated Values (CSV) files with an R script and manual cleaning, resulting in a final CSV file of 346 exported results.\nThe Eurêka database indexes approximately 2,500 sources covering current events on the local, regional, national, and international levels. “GESAMP” or “group of experts on the scientific aspect of marine” was searched in all its archives and content. This search retrieved 213 results.\nThe ProQuest News and Newspapers database includes seven newspapers/services: Canadian Newsstream, Global Breaking Newswires, International Newsstream, ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The Globe and Mail, ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times with Index, ProQuest Historical Newspapers: Toronto Star, and U.S. Newsstream. A search for “GESAMP” or “group of experts on the scientific aspect of marine” retrieved 93 results.\nThe NexisUni database indexes over 15,000 news, business, and legal source articles focusing on business, political science, and criminal justice. A search for “GESAMP” or “group of experts on the scientific aspects of marine” retrieved 189 results. \nThe Research Library database searches multiple interdisciplinary journal sources spanning multiple disciplines and fields. With an international scope, the database comprises a smaller collection of sources, including over 2,300 journals and newspaper sources, as well as recent newswire feeds. A search for “GESAMP” or “group of experts on the scientific aspects of marine” produced 70 results.\nThe combined news mentions dataset contains 911 items with seven metadata fields. After filtering out items with the type “journalArticle” from the Eurêka results (62 items), unique news items can be distinguished by title, publication, and year, leaving 716 results. Note that this curated dataset does not preclude duplicates published in multiple publications or translated works.\nWe subsequently examined the context in which GESAMP was mentioned to identify the specific report that was mentioned, and were able to identify 217 news items mentioning a specific GESAMP publication."

Citations slightly increased after 2000 but fluctuated consistently every few years, and 2016 marks the beginning of a sharp increase in citations. Citation counts after 2020 may not accurately represent the full reach of publications, as citations take time to accumulate. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Citations to GESAMP publications over time\n\n\n\nGESAMP publications have been cited in works published by 1,120 journals. Figure 2 presents the top 25 journals that have cited GESAMP publications the most, with Marine Pollution Bulletin being the journal in which GESAMP publications are the most cited, and by a substantial number. This journal cited GESAMP literature over twice as much as Science of the Total Environment, which has the second highest number of citations to GESAMP work. Environmental Pollution, Ocean & Coastal Management, and Frontiers in Marine Science, comprising the rest of the top 5 journals citing GESAMP publications, indicate a focus on pollution and ocean management. The topic of pollution is also present among the remaining top 20 journals (such as Environmental Science and Pollution Research, Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology, and Water Air and Soil Pollution) as are the subjects of toxicology and hazardous materials (Chemosphere, Journal of Hazardous Materials, Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety, and Aquatic Toxicology), indicating the relevance and utility of GESAMP literature to research published in these journals. Other journals tend to focus on science, technology, ecology, environmental/marine research, and management, whereas topics relating to policy appear less represented. However, several key marine management journals, such as Marine Policy and Coastal Management, show significant interest in GESAMP work. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Top journals citing GESAMP publications\n\n\n\nPublication-level references to GESAMP work show that the three most cited GESAMP reports address issues related to plastic pollution in marine environments (#90, #99, #93 – Table 4).

Another report, appearing in the most cited publications of GESAMP, is The Revised GESAMP Hazard Evaluation Procedure for Chemical Substances Carried by Ships (#64), which provides guidelines for the transport of chemical substances in ships and has been updated in recent reports. While the three most cited reports were published in recent years, citations to recent GESAMP work still need some time to accumulate, as the other 12 publications included in the top 15 most cited reports were published more than 12 years ago.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Publication-level citations to GESAMP reports.\n\n\n\nTitleYearCitationsSources, Fate and Effects of Microplastics in the Marine Environment (Part 1) (#90)2,015840Guidelines for the Monitoring and Assessment of Plastic Litter in the Ocean (#99)2,019436Sources, Fate and Effects of Microplastics in the Marine Environment (Part 2) (#93)2,016406The State of the Marine Environment (#39)1,990259The Contributions of Science to Integrated Coastal Management (#61)1,996160Protecting the Oceans from Land-based Activities (#71)2,001133Impact of Oil and Related Chemicals on the Marine Environment (#50)1,993132Land/Sea Boundary Flux of Contaminants: Contributions from Rivers (#32)1,987108Estimates of Oil Entering the Marine Environment from Sea-based Activities (#75)2,00797Opportunistic Settlers and the Problem of the Ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi Invasion in the Black Sea (#58)1,99796A Sea of Troubles (#70)2,00195The Atmospheric Input of Trace Species to the World Ocean (#38)1,98994Proceedings of the GESAMP Workshop on Microplastic particles (#82)2,01089Towards Safe and Effective Use of Chemicals in Coastal Aquaculture (#65)1,99781The Revised GESAMP Hazard Evaluation Procedure for Chemical Substances Carried by Ships (#64)2,00278"

The United Nations Environment Programme and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations are the top two citers of GESAMP literature. Data collected from Overton reveals frequent self-citations of GESAMP to its own work; the top two citers corroborate the finding that the UN often draws on its own work to advance and build knowledge. Other top citers include the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the World Meteorological Organization, and UNESCO, which shows strong international confidence in GESAMP literature for their work. Other global bodies that are not solely mandated for environmental protection or have dedicated environmental units include the World Health Organization and the World Bank. Specific national or international actors include the State of South Australia (concerned mainly with protecting the Great Barrier Reef), Natural Resources Institute Finland, the German Institute for Economic Research, and the Publications Office of the European Union.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Top 15 policy sources citing GESAMP publications\n\n\n\nTable 5 shows the top 15 report-level policy citations to GESAMP Reports and Studies. Notably, 11 of the 15 publications were produced in the 2000s, despite GESAMP reports dating back to the 1960s. This suggests that GESAMP reports have influenced policymaking in recent years, possibly due to the organization establishing itself during its first few decades, when grey literature was more challenging to access online. However, one report from the 1980s and three from the 1990s received significant engagement in policy documents. The 1980 report, “Interchange of Pollutants Between the Atmosphere and the Ocean,” for example, received the third-highest amount of policy mentions. The top two most cited reports are from more recent years and are complementary documents: Parts 1 (#90) and 2 (#93) of Sources, Fate and Effects of Microplastics in the Marine Environment appear to reflect important concerns in the policy sphere in recent years.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Publication-level policy indicators to GESAMP reports\n\n\n\nTitleYearPolicy citationsSources, Fate and Effects of Microplastics in the Marine Environment (Part 1) (#90)2,015113Sources, Fate and Effects of Microplastics in the Marine Environment (Part 2) (#93)2,01681Interchange of Pollutants Between the Atmosphere and the Ocean (#13)1,98072Protecting the Oceans from Land-based Activities (#71)2,00145Planning and Management for Sustainable Coastal Aquaculture Development (#68)2,00134Guidelines for the Monitoring and Assessment of Plastic Litter in the Ocean (#99)2,01934The State of the Marine Environment (#39)1,99033Towards Safe and Effective Use of Chemical in Coastal Aquaculture (#65)1,99731Assessment and communication of environmental risks in coastal aquaculture (#76)2,00826A Sea of Troubles (#70)2,00124The Atmospheric Input of Chemicals to the Ocean (#84)2,01223Proceedings of the GESAMP Workshop on Microplastic particles (#82)2,01019The magnitude and impacts of anthropogenic atmospheric nitrogen inputs to the ocean (#97)2,01819Monitoring the Ecological Effects of Coastal Aquaculture Wastes (#57)1,99618Sea-based sources of marine litter (#108)2,02117"

After 2010, a noticeable rise in news mentions of GESAMP publications can be observed. In 2022, in particular, there was a marked rise in news mentions, likely due to increased mainstream attention to the UN’s declared Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030) and the ongoing climate emergency (UNESCO, 2017; UNESCO-IOC, 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Number of news media mentions of GESAMP publications by year\n\n\n\nThese new works were published by 336 different publications/services, of which the top 25 are shown in Figure 6 below.

Overall, the representation of international news services is less than that of national sources. The World Bank (MENA Report) is also represented in top news sources, as it is among the top policy citers in the GESAMP literature, being the only organization, other than the European Union, to be represented in both policy and news groups. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Top news media publication or service by number of mentions\n\n\n\nReport-level news mentions of GESAMP Reports and Studies are depicted in Table 6.

    "text": "Summary of findings\nThis analysis of literature citing GESAMP publications utilized references from scholarly articles in the Web of Science, policy documents from Overton, and news mentions from Factiva, Eurêka, ProQuest News and Newspapers, NexisUni, and Research Library. All three indicators show a continuous growth in engagement with GESAMP publications over time, with an acceleration occurring around the mid-2010s. This timing aligns with an increased awareness of climate change and ocean pollution. For instance, the UN’s First World Ocean Assessment, released in 2017, exposed the degraded state of the oceans (UNESCO, 2017) and catalyzed national action. Canada, for example, launched a $1.5 billion Oceans Protection Plan (OPP), the largest federal government investment in ocean protection (DFO Maritimes Region OPP Atlantic Hub, 2020). Such efforts around the globe may have spurred research drawing on GESAMP publications. As 2021 marked the beginning of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, GESAMP reports are likely to continue being needed and used.\nGESAMP publication gets cited on average 6.2 times in policy documents indexed in Overton. Without a proper benchmark, it is difficult to determine whether or not this is a low or high number of policy citations. Still, past evidence on policy citations to scholarly literature suggests much lower rates of policy citations for this type of document. For example, research articles related to sharks analyzed in Toupin et al. (2023) paper had, on average, 0.19 policy citations according to Altmetric.com. Dorta-González et al. (2024) analyzed the policy citations of 124,778 articles published in journals containing the term “policy” in their title and found and found an average of 0.6 policy citations according to Altmetric.com and an average of 2.3 policy citations according to Overton. Thus, an average of 6.2 for GESAMP reports signals an above-average use in policy. This was perhaps to be expected as it is one of the intended purposes of GESAMP reports, unlike scholarly articles, which can be relevant for policy but are typically intended first and foremost for scientific audiences. Although it’s mostly UN organizations that draw from GESAMP, the expert group is also referenced in documents produced by the Canadian and United Kingdom governments, as well as by organizations such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\nSimilarly, we have no suitable benchmark against which to assess whether 5.4 news mentions per GESAMP publication is high or low. Still, this number is about five times higher than the average number of news mentions of papers in Toupin et al. (2023), suggesting a high level of visibility of GESAMP publications in the news.\nIt is also challenging to determine whether the total of 4,713 citations or the average of 39.27 citations per GESAMP publication is high or low without a benchmark of other grey literature or scholarly outputs. The average citations to the set of shark-related papers in Toupin et al. (2023) was lower at 23.9. According to data from OpenAlex (Priem et al., n.d.), papers in Marine Pollution Bulletin have received an average of 35.6 times1. These numbers suggest that GESAMP publications play an important role not only in policymaking but also in science published in a range of journals, such as Marine Pollution Bulletin, Science of the Total Environment, and Environmental Pollution.\n1 It should be noted that because of its its more extensive coverage, OpenAlex citation counts are likely to be higher than citation counts obtained from the Web of Science, which we used for this study.Some of the most frequently cited and mentioned GESAMP publications have focused on plastic pollution in the ocean, a topic of growing interest in recent years. These reports were highly discussed in the news media upon publication. We also observe that GESAMP’s most frequently mentioned work in policy documents and news media was published in recent years, a stark contrast to citations. Some possible explanations include a faster accumulation of use in the news and policy compared to citations, which take more time to accumulate, or heightened visibility and accessibility of grey literature in the digital era."

By examining the dissemination and uptake of GESAMP reports across scholarly, policy, and media domains, it reinforces the notion that boundary organizations are not only conduits of information but active agents in shaping environmental discourse and decision-making. Kettle et al. (2017) and Leith et al. (2016) highlight the importance of boundary organizations, and our analysis of GESAMP’s increasing visibility illustrates how sustained engagement and institutional support can enhance the reach and influence of scientific advisory bodies. Bednarek et al. (2018) emphasize the importance of trust, credibility, and strategic communication in boundary-spanning work. Our findings echo these insights by showing how GESAMP’s outputs gain traction among diverse stakeholders. Cvitanovic et al. (2014);Cvitanovic et al. (2015); Cvitanovic et al. (2016) highlight the challenges of knowledge exchange in marine resource management. Our study contributes to demonstrating how grey literature, when strategically produced and disseminated, can support adaptive governance and evidence-based decision-making, particularly in ocean management. Ultimately, our study provides a compelling case for investing in boundary-spanning mechanisms that amplify the societal value of environmental science.\nOur study also constitutes a methodological contribution to research aimed at measuring the impact of gray literature and the organizations that produce it. Indeed, capturing the use of grey literature is challenging, and while our process relied largely on manual searches and verifications, which makes it difficult to scale up, it may nonetheless provide guidance for others who wish to replicate or expand on our process to measure the impact of grey literature. Finally, a practical implication of our work and the process it illustrates is the potential for GESAMP and similar organizations to evaluate the impact of their contributions, and more importantly, to communicate it to stakeholders and other organizations on which they may depend for legitimacy or funding.\nThis study’s approach possesses several limitations. A search for GESAMP publications was conducted across databases by searching for “gesamp” and its full name. Reports were not searched for at an individual level, which may have limited the comprehensiveness of the retrieved results from databases. As extensive as the coverage of our data sources may be this report underestimates the total engagement of GESAMP literature."

    "text": "Concluding remarks\nThis study underscores the growing relevance and reach of grey literature produced by environmental scientific advisory bodies, using GESAMP as a compelling case study. Despite the inherent challenges in tracking and quantifying the impact of non-indexed outputs, our multi-source approach reveals a clear upward trajectory in the visibility and use of GESAMP reports across scholarly, policy, and media landscapes. The increasing citation of these reports in academic literature—particularly in fields related to marine pollution and ocean governance—demonstrates their value in shaping scientific discourse. Moreover, the engagement from national and regional environmental organizations highlights the broader impact of GESAMP’s work beyond its sponsoring institutions.\nThese findings underscore the importance of developing robust mechanisms to monitor and assess the impact of grey literature, particularly as it continues to inform critical environmental decision-making. As global challenges intensify, the ability of expert groups like GESAMP to synthesize knowledge and disseminate it effectively to diverse audiences will remain essential. Future research should explore additional platforms and metrics to capture the nuanced pathways through which such reports contribute to policy development, public awareness, and scientific progress. Strengthening the visibility and traceability of grey literature will ultimately enhance its utility and legitimacy in the environmental knowledge ecosystem."
